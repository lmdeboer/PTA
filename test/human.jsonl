Researchers have an answer.\n\nA Virginia public school student suggested he might carry out an ethnic cleansing at his school. Officials were alarmed, but they weren't sure whether he was serious. They convened a team to assess the threat and notified the police, who found an unsecured loaded semiautomatic pistol in a search of his home.\n\nAn investigation revealed online messages with a friend in another state considering a similar act — acts that police then thwarted, according to Dewey Cornell, a scholar who keeps track of these incidents but does not give out time or location information to protect the confidentiality of the districts and students.\n\nOne of the stickiest dilemmas that counselors and teachers face is how to know which students are poised to commit a horrid act of violence and which ones just need help, even urgently. Every day, they walk a terrifying tightrope: Removing every student who shows disturbing behaviors would amount to a huge overreaction. Missing just one true killer could be a tragic underreaction.\n\n\"It boils down to a judgment call,\" said Melissa Reeves, former president of the National Association of School Psychologists. \"We don't have a cookbook that says if this situation happens, do this.\"\n\nIncreasingly, school officials rely on sophisticated threat detection systems designed to head off horrific mass shootings like the one last week in Oxford, Mich. When officials encounter concerns, they might look at social media posts, search a student's locker or desk and examine academic and disciplinary records. Officials might investigate the student's access to weapons, recent stressful events in the student's life, evidence of depression or suicidal thoughts, evidence of planning an attack and consistency of a student's statements and actions.\n\nIn Oxford, 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley came to the attention of guidance counselors, who sent him back to class. Later that day, he is alleged to have opened fire, killing four students and injuring seven others.\n\nMany academics, school officials and law enforcement agencies suggest decisions like this be made by a much larger, multidisciplinary team including administrators, school-based police officers and mental health professionals such as school counselors, psychologists and social workers.\n\n\"It doesn't rest on one person's shoulders, or one or two,\" said Michele Gay, whose 7-year-old daughter Josephine was killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. Gay now runs a nonprofit organization that brings threat assessment training to U.S. schools. \"We know that it works, we know it saves lives.\"\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service has long wrestled with this problem as it has sought to evaluate people who might attack the president or other protected officials. In 1999, after a mass shooting at Columbine High School outside Denver left 13 people dead, the agency realized its methods could be used to evaluate threats in schools, too, and began sharing its tools with educators. By 2018, the Secret Service's National Threat Assessment Center had published a 32-page guide that recommended multidisciplinary threat assessment teams, with a set of criteria for intervention. The FBI also sees threat assessment as a valuable tool in trying to prevent mass school shootings.\n\n\"You can't catch someone falling from a building if you're the only one holding the net,\" said Katherine Schweit, a former FBI special agent and author of the book, \"Stop the Killing: How to End the Mass Shooting Crisis.\"\n\nMass shootings in the U.S. are overwhelmingly committed by men. Experts are examining the place of masculinity in the gun debate. (Video: Nicki DeMarco, Erin Patrick O'Connor, Sarah Hashemi/The Washington Post)\n\nAfter the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech, in which 32 people were killed, Virginia became the first state to mandate threat assessment teams, taking the approach recommended by the Secret Service. The requirement was imposed first on universities and, in 2013, on K-12 schools. Now at least 11 states require schools to put these teams in place. One study found that by 2017, about half of American secondary schools and more than 40 percent of primary schools used threat assessment teams."}

He wanted to \"acknowledge the deep and tremendous pain that all of the families are feeling, especially the Floyd family,\" the judge said.\n\nIn a 22 page memorandum, Cahill wrote that two aggravating factors warranted a harsher sentence – that Chauvin \"abused his position of trust or authority\" and treated Floyd with \"particular cruelty.\" Chauvin, the judge wrote, treated Floyd \"without respect and denied him the dignity owed to all human beings.\"\n\nCahill said the former officer \"objectively remained indifferent to Mr. Floyd's pleas' even as Mr. Floyd was begging for his life and obviously terrified by the knowledge that he was likely to die.\"\n\n\"Mr. Chauvin's prolonged restraint of Mr. Floyd was also much longer and more painful than the typical scenario in a second-degree or third-degree murder or second-degree manslaughter case,\" the judge wrote.\n\nChauvin will remain in a restricted housing unit separated from the general population at the Minnesota Correctional Facility- Oak Park Heights \"for the time being,\" Minnesota Department of Corrections spokesperson Sarah Fitzgerald told CNN.\n\n\"His ultimate placement is undetermined, but his safety will be our predominate concern when determining final placement,\" Fitzgerald said, adding Chauvin has been on administrative segregation status for his \"general safety.\"\n\nPeople watch hearing on phone at corner where Floyd was killed\n\nChauvin, 45, was convicted in April on charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for his role in Floyd's death.\n\nFloyd's final moments, captured on searing cell phone footage by a 17-year-old, illustrated in clear visuals what Black Americans have long said about how the criminal justice system treats Black people.

These deaths were a sore point for Cuomo, whose daily pandemic briefings last year elevated him to national prominence as a straight-talking teller of home truths. But now it turns out that the governor—while basking in media adulation as a hero of the pandemic—covered up the extent of the problem specifically because, according to reporting from the New York Post, his office didn't want President Trump to \"turn this into a giant political football\" by instructing the Department of Justice to investigate Cuomo's handling of the situation. In other words, Cuomo buried evidence and impeded a federal investigation, hoping that a new administration would leave him alone.\n\nLate last March, Cuomo's state health commissioner Howard Zucker signed a decree ordering nursing homes to admit or readmit Covid patients released from hospitals, even if they remained infectious. The decision was made when the primary fear of rising contagion was that hospital emergency rooms and intensive-care units would be overrun by the desperately sick; moving stabilized patients into care facilities appeared to be the least bad option.\n\nCuomo cannot in good faith be faulted for initially making this determination, though it allowed the virus to spread like fire throughout the state's nursing homes, infecting and killing the elderly and immune-compromised in droves. But he can be held to account for not rescinding the statewide order until May 10, well after it was obvious that hospitals were not being swamped by patients requiring intubation and that the policy was causing massive death in the nursing homes.\n\nCuomo ducked press demands for nursing-home mortality data throughout 2020, even as every other state made the information public. While New York admitted to about 7,000 nursing home deaths, informed estimates put the real count at around 12,000; the state refused to confirm the numbers.

Can a former president be impeached?\n\nAs the United States Senate opens its second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, senators will grapple with thorny political and legal questions, top constitutional lawyers tell Al Jazeera.\n\n\"An impeachment and a Senate trial are a unique constitutional procedure that is entirely in the control of the House and Senate,\" said Jan Baran, a US Supreme Court practitioner at Holtzman Vogel Josefiak and Torchinsky in Washington.\n\n\"Whether they do the right thing by impeaching or by convicting is ultimately within the judgement of the American public and the voters,\" Baran told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe US Constitution gives Congress the sole power to impeach and remove a president and bar them from holding future office for committing \"treason, high crimes and misdemeanors\". The courts have almost no say in how Congress proceeds.\n\nIn an impeachment, the House of Representatives acts like a grand jury and appoints managers to prosecute the charge. The Senate conducts the trial with individual senators acting as jurors and providing a forum for presentation of evidence and arguments.\n\nA two-thirds majority of the Senate is required to convict, a very high bar that has never been met for a president in US history.\n\nWhat has Trump been charged with?\n\nFormer President Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives on a charge of \"incitement of insurrection\" after the US Capitol was invaded by his political supporters on January 6.\n\nTrump had hosted a rally of supporters near the White House on the same day Congress was meeting to certify Joe Biden's election victory. In a fiery speech, Trump had urged them to march on the Capitol.\n\nThe House article of impeachment charges that Trump gave a speech in which he \"reiterated false claims\" he had won the 2020 presidential election and urged the crowd to \"fight like hell\".\n\nThe crowd \"breached and vandalized the Capitol\", killing a police officer and injuring many more, and \"menaced\" members of Congress.\n\nThe article alleges Trump's prior conduct included \"efforts to subvert and obstruct the certification of the results of the 2020 presidential election\".\n\nAs such, the former president \"threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power and imperiled a coequal branch of government\", the House said.\n\nWhat has been the response of Trump's defence lawyers?\n\nTrump's lawyers are insisting he did not incite a riot at the US Capitol last month and argue that his impeachment by the House should be dismissed by the Senate.\n\nIn a pre-trial brief filed on February 8, Trump's legal team, Bruce Castor and David Schoen, offered a robust response to House Democrats' charges that the former president is guilty of \"incitement of insurrection\".\n\nTrump's lawyers argue that in addition to his remarks being protected by the US Constitution's First Amendment, which guarantees the freedom of speech, \"not a single word encouraged violence or lawlessness, explicitly or implicitly\".\n\nIn the brief filed on Monday, the lawyers offered a litany of evidence to bolster the arguments they filed last week in response to the House Democrats' article of impeachment, prosecuting Trump with \"incitement\".\n\nIs it unconstitutional to impeach a former president?\n\nAlthough it has never been done before, the consensus among legal experts is the House and Senate have authority to impeach a former US official, including a former president."}

It should ensure every citizen—regardless of gender—has an equal voice.\n\nAnd free and fair elections that will respect the will of the people.\n\nAt the same time, democracy requires constant vigilance, constant improvement.\n\nIt is a work-in-progress.\n\nAnd today, we know that democracy is increasingly under great strain.\n\nFor 15 consecutive years, we have seen a troubling decline in freedom around the globe.\n\nIn fact, experts believe that this past year was the worst on record for the global deterioration of democracy and freedom.\n\nSo, even as we confront a global health crisis and an economic crisis, it is critical that we continue to defend democracy.\n\nTo that end, the United States is strengthening our engagement with the United Nations and the broader multilateral system.\n\nWe are also rejoining the Human Rights Council.\n\nBecause we know the status of democracy depends on our collective commitment to those values articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nThe status of democracy also depends fundamentally on the empowerment of women.\n\nNot only because the exclusion of women in decision-making is a marker of a flawed democracy, but because the participation of women strengthens democracy.\n\nAnd that's true everywhere.\n\nLooking around the world, I am inspired by the progress that is being made.\n\nAnd I am proud to report that, while the United States still has work to do, we, too, are making progress—and that women strengthen our democracy everyday.\n\nIn every presidential election for the last 56 years, in the United States, more women have voted than men.\n\nMore women than ever before serve in the United States Congress.\n\nMore women than ever before are their family's breadwinner.\n\nAnd just last week, the President nominated two women to take the helm of two of our 11 combatant commands.\n\nWomen in the United States lead our local, state, and national governments, make major decisions regarding our nation's security, and drive major growth in our economy.\n\nThese are signs of progress. These are signs of strength.\n\nBut, friends, we cannot take this progress for granted.\n\nEspecially now.\n\nCOVID-19 has threatened the economic security, the physical security, and the health of women everywhere.\n\nAs women struggle to get the healthcare they need, the pandemic appears to be reversing the global gains we've made in the fights against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, malnutrition, and maternal and child mortality.\n\nThat's why, on the first day of our Administration, the United States re-engaged as a member state and leader in the World Health Organization.\n\nAnd we are revitalizing our partnership with UN Women, to help empower women worldwide.\n\nHere's the truth:\n\nWhen women face obstacles to obtaining quality healthcare...\n\nWhen women face food insecurity...\n\nWhen women are more likely to live in poverty, and therefore disproportionately impacted by climate change...\n\nMore vulnerable to gender-based violence, and therefore disproportionately impacted by conflict...\n\nWell it's harder for women to fully participate in decision-making.\n\nWhich, in turn, makes it that much harder for democracies to thrive."}

Tom Rice, a staunch supporter of President Trump from deeply conservative South Carolina, issued a plea as rioters raged through the Capitol last week. \"Where is the president!?\" Rice asked. \"He must ask people to disperse and restore calm now.\" Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight On Wednesday, exactly one week later, Rice voted with Democrats to impeach Trump, saying, \"I have backed this President through thick and thin for four years. I campaigned for him and voted for him twice. But, this utter failure is inexcusable.\"\n\nAll told, 10 Republicans voted with the Democrats to impeach Trump on charges of \"incitement of insurrection.\" Although the group represents a small fraction of the conference, their support gives impeachment bipartisan bona fides that could help it gain traction in the Senate. It also reflects the deep division within the Republican Party about its future and the role the president should play.\n\nThe group represents the party's ideological spectrum, from Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), who holds a leadership position, to moderate Rep. Fred Upton (Mich.), to Rice.\n\nThe others who voted to impeach Trump are Anthony Gonzalez (Ohio), Jaime Herrera Beutler (Wash.), John Katko (N.Y.), Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), Peter Meijer (Mich.), Dan Newhouse (Wash.) and David Valadao (Calif.).\n\nIn statements, many called their decision of vote of conscience.\n\n\"Based on the facts before me, I have to go with my gut and vote my conscience,\" tweeted Valado, a returning member who just won his seat back from a Democrat. Trump's \"inciting rhetoric was un-American, abhorrent, and absolutely an impeachable offense. It's time to put country over politics.\"\n\n\"This is not a vote I took lightly, but a vote I took confidently,\" tweeted Kinzinger, who has condemned Trump's behavior since the election. \"I'm at peace.\"\n\nSome of Trump's top allies in the House tried to paint Kinzinger and others as a small rump. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), among Trump's staunchest congressional defenders, said the fact that only 10 Republicans joined the Democrats showed the president's support remained strong.\n\nAsked whether Trump could remain an effective leader of the party, Jordan said, \"Of course, he is.\"\n\n\"His support is strong because the American people appreciated that over the past four years he did more of what he said he would do than any president in my lifetime,\" Jordan said.\n\nBut other House Republicans said the lopsided GOP vote reflected concerns about the impeachment process and should not be seen as an endorsement of Trump's behavior.\n\n\"It actually represents a feeling among Republicans — even Republicans who are disappointed with this president — that with only seven days left to go in his term and with the toxic political environment being what it is, that there's a real need in the country to lower the temperature,\" said Rep. Garland \"Andy\" Barr (R-Ky.). \"This is viewed by a lot of Americans as an act of political vengeance.\"\n\nAs the articles of impeachment now move to the Senate for a trial, several Republicans have signaled a willingness to convict Trump, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who told colleagues earlier in the day that he had \"not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate,\" according to his office.\n\nSeveral Senate Republicans expressed similar sentiments, a strikingly different tone from the cries of a \"witch hunt\" during Trump's first impeachment in December 2019.\n\n\"I stand by my statements over the last week regarding President Trump and the role he played in the deadly riot at the Capitol,\" said Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), who has called for Trump to resign over the attacks. \"Whether or not the Senate has the constitutional authority to hold an impeachment trial for a president that is no longer in office is debatable. Should the Senate conduct a trial, I will again fulfill my responsibility to consider arguments from both the House managers and President Trump's lawyers.\"\n\nOther Senate Republicans focused on how everything started, with Trump's refusal to accept the results of the election and his baseless insistence that they had been rigged.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who has been critical of Trump's efforts to subvert the election, said everything that has happened since Nov. 3 is the result of a \"particular lie.\""}

Deal volume was at record highs and showed no signs of letting up. Over at investment banking rival Goldman Sachs, young analysts made headlines with workplace horror stories that went beyond the typical long hours and cutthroat competition that Wall Street's known for. They were falling apart, mentally and emotionally.\n\nFraser saw an opportunity. And the memo she sent to Citi's 210,000 global staff would set the tone for how she would try to overhaul Citigroup — long languishing in third place and mired in bad press.\n\n\"The blurring of lines between home and work and the relentlessness of the pandemic workday have taken a toll on our well-being,\" she wrote. \"It's simply not sustainable.\"\n\nWhat followed was a reset plan that included the kinds of work-life balance measures you don't often see on Wall Street. Fraser implemented \"Zoom-free Fridays\" and urged staff to avoid scheduling calls outside traditional work hours. Take your vacations, she pleaded. Veteran bankers must have thought they were in the Twilight Zone.\n\nThen came the real shock: When Citi ultimately returns to the office, most roles will be designated as \"hybrid\" — with three days in office and up to two at home. Among American banks, that kind of flexibility was unheard of.\n\nIt was both a humane reaction to a mass trauma and a calculated strategic decision. By branding itself the \"bank with a soul,\" as Fraser calls it, Citi would have an edge in scooping up and retaining talent that might otherwise eschew Wall Street for the less-frenzied, or at least less formal, world of tech.\n\nFraser readily admits the decision wasn't purely about empathy — \"I want to crush the competition,\" she told Bloomberg News last month. But by not cracking the whip, she's also staking out a somewhat radical position on Wall Street: that ruthlessness doesn't have to define a bank's culture.\n\nBanking analysts and investors will be closely watching Fraser in March, when she plans to unveil Citigroup's cultural and structural rehabilitation plan for the next several years. It'll also mark her first full year as CEO — a timely check-in to see how her strategy is playing out.\n\nBy branding itself the \"bank with a soul,\" as Fraser calls it, Citi would have an edge in scooping up talent that might otherwise eschew Wall Street for the world of tech.\n\nNo one expects her to wave a magic wand and undo decades' worth of mismanagement overnight. But the March investor day will be a crucial early test. Shareholders are hungry for bold action. The biggest risk, says longtime banking analyst Mike Mayo, is not that the plan will be too aggressive — it's that it won't be aggressive enough.\n\nTurnaround job\n\nIt's hard to overstate what a difficult job Fraser, the first woman to lead a top American bank, has inherited.\n\nCitigroup's (C) stock is wildly underperforming. Its shares are up about 13% this year — dismal compared with the broader stock market, which has gained 24% in 2021. Citi's rivals are outpacing it by even more: Bank of America (BAC) is up 60%, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is up 35%.\n\nIt's also under intense pressure from regulators, who for years have been cajoling the bank to overhaul its hodgepodge of internal risk-management and data systems.\n\nRegulators' concerns aren't unfounded. In August 2020, Citi committed one of the biggest blunders in the history of Wall Street when it erroneously wired nearly $1 billion of its own money to creditors of Revlon. The fat-finger error ultimately cost Citi more than $500 million when several of those creditors refused to return the funds.\n\nJust two months later, regulators slapped Citigroup with a $400 million fine for failing to address \"long-standing deficiencies.\"\n\nFraser's shakeup of office culture is a relatively easy win — necessary, perhaps, but far from sufficient, analysts say.\n\n\"Every day she gets a grade from shareholders, and that's the stock price,\" Mayo said in an interview with CNN Business. \"And every day that she's been in the role, the verdict is Citigroup is worth more dead than alive.\"\n\nIt's not enough to change the tone at the top, Mayo said. Fraser, who declined to comment for this article, has to address the sort governance lapses that have gotten the bank in trouble.\n\nIn a recent note to clients, Mayo and other analysts criticized Citi's decision to identify potential cash bonuses for top managers before their performance targets are even announced. \"That's like charging us for dinner before we know if we're getting hot dogs or caviar,\" the note said. \"Moreover, the awards are in cash vs. stock and seem like extra pay to execs for just doing their job.\"\n\nThat's terrible governance, Mayo says. \"And that's the terrible governance Citigroup has had for the last 10, 20, 50 or 100 years.\"\n\nBetter Call Jane\n\nThankfully for Citigroup, Fraser's no stranger to cleanup jobs.\n\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, the bank very nearly collapsed because of its exposure to toxic mortgage-backed securities. As Citigroup hobbled along on life support in the form of a massive government bailout, Fraser — who joined the bank in 2004 —ran its strategy division, overseeing sales of risky assets to streamline the bank's sprawling operations.\n\nShe later ran Citigroup's battered mortgage business and its Latin America operations, both decidedly thorny assignments in the fallout of the financial crisis.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with CNN, Fraser recalled people telling her she was \"crazy\" for taking over CitiMortgage just a few years after the housing market imploded. In hindsight, she said, it was the \"best decision I've ever made.\"\n\nThe lesson: You don't have to know everything.\n\n\"You learn from those situations... Because it was a crisis and because I didn't know anything,\" she said. \"You have to hire people that are better than you and more knowledgeable than you.\"\n\nFraser is widely credited for cleaning up Citi's Mexican subsidiary, which was emerging from a money-laundering scandal when she became CEO of Citigroup's Latin America operations in 2015. In that role, she also steered the bank through the devastation of Hurricane Maria. When the storm forced Citi's San Juan, Puerto Rico, branch to close, she oversaw efforts to bring in generators and other necessities to get the bank back up and running a week later.\n\n\"We don't leave a country when it's in really bad shape,\" Fraser told the New York Times in an interview in February. \"We can really make a difference.\"\n\nFraser, 54, comes to the role of CEO armed with a resume straight out of Wall Street central casting. She worked as a Goldman Sachs analyst after receiving her degree in economics at Cambridge. Then came the Harvard MBA, followed by a decade of work at consulting giant McKinsey before joining Citigroup in 2004.\n\nA 'glass cliff' moment?\n\nFraser regularly downplays the gender question in interviews. The fact that she's a woman running a major bank is historic, but it should hardly matter as long she does the job well. And that's true. But it's also impossible to ignore Corporate America's track record of sticking a woman in the driver's seat when the wheels are about to come off.\n\nResearch shows that women are more likely to be promoted to senior leadership positions when institutions are in trouble — a trend known as the glass cliff. Mary Barra, famously, made history as the first woman to run General Motors in 2014. But the automaker was a mess, still crawling out of bankruptcy and, two weeks into Barra's tenure, issuing a massive recall linked to 13 deaths that the company had known about for years.\n\nThere was a similar sense of crisis at Citi that accelerated Fraser's ascension."}

The company also removed accounts run by anti-vaccine groups that were using evolving tactics to attack doctors in Europe.\n\nTogether, the cat-and-mouse game described in the company's latest threat report continues to demonstrate how social media is an active battlefield where governments and motivated parties attempt to manipulate public opinion. It also shows the might of the global platform, which has recently come under renewed fire for its role in spreading societal harms.\n\nFacebook, which recently changed its corporate name to Meta, began to develop strategies to fight disinformation campaigns after Russian actors exploited its service during the 2016 election to influence the outcome. Since then, the company has engaged in hundreds of takedowns involving shadowy political organizations, marketing firms, governments and profit-motivated groups. Russia, the company said in a report last year, was still the biggest player in foreign disinformation.\n\nMeanwhile, the threat landscape has evolved significantly. Governments now outsource their disinformation efforts to a growing number of private disinformation-for-hire firms, who sometimes pay unwitting legitimate journalists and influencers to write about topics of interest. Fake profiles can now be generated by artificial intelligence. And a Facebook whistleblower and other critics have accused the company of turning a blind eye to domestic actors that seek to exploit public opinion in their own countries — particularly if those countries are strategic for Facebook's business interests.\n\nThe Facebook Papers show what its employees knew about how the website fostered polarization and how it contrasted with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's public comments. (Video: JM Rieger/The Washington Post)\n\nFacebook does not disclose the reach of the disinformation campaigns, making it difficult for outsiders to gauge their actual influence. It discloses accounts removed and the followers of those accounts, but not the views that the posts received.\n\nThe China operation was discovered, the company said, after a mysterious account claiming to be a Swiss biologist posted that the United States was pressuring and intimidating World Health Organization scientists studying the origins of the coronavirus in an attempt to blame China for the virus. The false persona was named Wilson Edwards and made the posts on Twitter and Facebook in July.\n\nAlmost immediately after the fake biologist's account, which was created only the day before, began posting its messages, Chinese state-controlled media organizations Global Times and People's Daily began covering the fake scientist's story. Facebook initially received reports about the fake account, and began to tie it and a network of hundreds of other fake personas amplifying it to actors in China, including a state-owned infrastructure company.\n\nWhile Facebook fell short of saying that the operation — which it said was quickly rooted out — was tied directly to the Chinese government, experts say such unusual timing often suggests a coordinated effort."}

A southbound convoy is also blocked, it said.\n\nThe passage accounts for approximately 30% of container ship traffic globally each day, according to Reuters, with the alternative shipping route between Asia and Europe – navigating around the African cape – taking a week longer.\n\nNearly 19,000 ships, or an average of 51.5 ships per day, with a net tonnage of 1.17 billion tonnes passed through the canal during 2020, according to the Suez Canal Authority.\n\nMaersk, the world's largest container shipping company said seven of its container vessels have been affected by the blockage, with four of its vessels stuck in the canal system while the rest are waiting to enter the passage, the Danish company said in a Wednesday statement.\n\nRe-floating the massive container vessel is \"technically very complicated\" and could take days, a senior canal pilot at the Suez Canal Authority told CNN.\n\nThe official – who spoke on condition of anonymity as he's not authorized to speak to the media – said that the equipment to float a ship is available but it depends on how it is used.\n\n\"If the method is not correct it might take a week, and if it's done well it might take two days. But if it had been correct [in the first place], then the crisis could have ended yesterday,\" the pilot said.\n\nThe official said that, due to the damage, the Ever Given is unlikely to be able to sail now and will probably need to be towed to the nearest parking site, the Great Bitter Lake District, about 30 kilometers to the north.\n\nAfterwards it will likely be towed with its cargo to the nearest port – either Sokhna port 20 kilometers south of the city of Suez, or Port Said, 100 kilometers to the north. There the cargo would be offloaded and the ship would undergo minor repairs. If the damage turns out to be more serious, the vessel would be towed to a marine shipyard.\n\nThe official said that \"at present, the number of ships waiting could reach 100, which will increase over time.\"\n\n\"The disruption of navigation is expected to cause ship congestion, which takes two to three days to normally restore traffic order,\" he added.\n\nThe impact on oil and gas flows will depend on how long it takes to clear the container ship, industry sources told Reuters."}

I promised when I got elected that I'd always give it to you straight from the shoulder — the good, the bad, the truth.\n\nSo, as we head into Christmas weekend, I want to answer your questions about the rising number of COVID cases — COVID-19 cases.\n\nAnd I want to start by acknowledging how tired, worried, and frustrated I know you are. I know how you're feeling.\n\nFor many of you, this will be the first or even the second Christmas where you look — across the table will be an empty kitchen chair there.\n\nTens of millions have gotten sick, and we've all experienced an upheaval in our lives.\n\nBut while COVID has been a tough adversary, we've shown that we're tougher — tougher because we have the power of science and vaccines that prevent illness and save lives, and tougher because of our resolve.\n\nSo, that — let me answer some questions that lay out the steps the Vice President and I are taking to prepare for the rising number of cases experts tell us we could expect in the weeks ahead.\n\nFirst, how concerned should you be about Omicron, which is now the dominant variant in this country and it happened so quickly?\n\nThe answer is straightforward: If you are not fully vaccinated, you have good reason to be concerned. You're at a high risk of getting sick. And if you get sick, you're likely to spread it to others, including friends and family. And the unvaccinated have a significantly higher risk of ending up in a hospital or even dying.\n\nAlmost everyone who has died from COVID-19 in the past many months has been unvaccinated. Unvaccinated.\n\nBut if you're among the majority of Americans who are fully vaccinated, and especially if you've gotten the booster shot — that third shot — you're much — you have much, much less reason to worry. You have a high degree of protection against severe illness.\n\nAnd because Omicron spreads so easily, we'll see some fully vaccinated people get COVID, potentially in large numbers. There will be positive cases in every office, even here in the White House, among the unv- — among the vaccinated — among the vaccinated — from Omicron.\n\nBut these cases are highly unlikely to lead to serious illness.\n\nVaccinated people who get COVID may get ill, but they're protected from severe illness and death. That's why you should still remain vigilant."}

Instead, Citi (C)bank accidentally wired almost 100 times that amount, including $175 million to a hedge fund. In all, Citi (C) accidentally sent $900 million to Revlon's lenders.\n\nSome lenders did return the money, but others did not. Citibank filed a lawsuit in August seeking the return of its funds, but it still has not received $500 million from 10 investment advisory firms after the accidental transfer.\n\nAn exception to the rule\n\nThe law usually punishes those who spend money accidentally deposited in their accounts. Accidental transfers are common in the digital age, and wires can be paid back instantly. A Pennsylvania couple faced felony charges after spending money accidentally deposited in their account.\n\nBut New York law has exceptions to this rule, known as the \"discharge-for-value-defense.\"\n\nIf the beneficiary is entitled to the money and did not know it was accidentally wired, they can keep it. Revlon lenders said they believed Citibank was wiring prepayments for a loan. After all, the money accidentally wired was the exact amount \"to the penny\" Citibank owed them, although the loan wasn't set to mature for quite some time.\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with Judge [Jesse] Furman's thoughtful, thorough and detailed decision,\" said Benjamin Finestone, who represented two lenders, Brigade and HPS Investment Partners.\n\n'Borderline irrational'\n\nThe court ruled the lenders were justified in believing the payment was intentional. Citibank itself did not realize the magnitude of its mistake until nearly a day later.\n\n\"To believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1 billion — would have been borderline irrational,\" the court document said.\n\nThe judge's ruling used internal chats between HPS employees as further proof the creditors had no idea the wiring was a mistake until after Citibank sent notices. In the chat, which was dated a day after the mistaken wiring, HPS employees joked about the error:\n\nDFREY5: I feel really bad for the person that fat fingered a $900mm erroneous payment. Not a great career move ... .\n\nJRABINOWIT12: certainly looks like they'll be looking for new people for their Ops group\n\nDFREY5: How was work today honey? It was ok, except I accidentally sent $900mm out to people who weren't supposed to have it\n\nDFREY5: Downside of work from home. maybe the dog hit the keyboard\n\nThe lenders cannot take the money and run. Since an appeal is a possibility, a temporary restraining order is still in effect.\n\n\"We strongly disagree with this decision and intend to appeal. We believe we are entitled to the funds and will continue to pursue a complete recovery of them,\" Citigroup said in a statement.\n\nThe pandemic has hurt makeup brands like Revlon (REV), shares of which are trading more than 40% lower from a year ago."}

In a recent interview with VOA Persian, Noronha said the department's USAdarFarsi (USA in Farsi) Instagram account grew its followers from 147,000 in January 2019 to 759,000 in January 2021, a more than five-fold increase in a two-year period.\n\nThe USAdarFarsi Facebook and Twitter channels also have more than 700,000 followers.\n\nNoronha said most engagement for the USAdarFarsi Instagram account comes from inside Iran where Instagram is the only major Western-run social media platform that Iranians can access freely. Facebook and Twitter are blocked by the Iranian government, leaving them accessible only to tech-savvy Iranians using virtual private networks.\n\nNoronha said VPNs, which hide a user's true location, make it hard for the State Department to determine how much traffic for its Persian Facebook and Twitter accounts comes from inside Iran versus from the Iranian diaspora. \"For the USAdarFarsi Twitter account, I'd say about half of our traffic comes from Iran and the other half from the U.S. and Europe,\" Noronha said. \"The Facebook account is somewhere between Twitter and Instagram (in terms of the amount of traffic that comes from Iran),\" he added.\n\nThe types of posts that got the most engagement on the USAdarFarsi accounts had three main themes, according to Noronha.\n\n\"Iranian social media users were most appreciative when we posted messages that supported their denunciations of the Iranian regime for imprisoning and executing rights activists, that endorsed their calls for anti-government protests and that celebrated Iranian cultural traditions pre-dating the nation's 1979 Islamic Revolution,\" he said. Iran's post-revolution clerical rulers have discouraged the observance of popular festivals and other cultural practices that they see as inconsistent with their fundamentalist view of Islam.\n\nNoronha said there was especially high traffic for Farsi-language tweets on Trump's personal Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump, which Twitter permanently suspended earlier this month citing perceived incitement to violence, a move denounced by Trump as an attempt to silence his free speech.\n\nTrump tweeted in Farsi seven times during his presidential term, according to the Trump Twitter Archive, an online resource cited by U.S. news outlets. His first Farsi tweet, posted on February 11, 2019, got 65,000 likes and accused Iran's rulers of 40 years of corruption, repression, terror and failure as they marked the 40th anniversary of their revolution.\n\nTrump's second Farsi tweet posted on January 11, 2020 contained a message in support of Iranian street protests against the Iranian military's downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane shortly after it took off from Tehran three days earlier. It was the most popular of his seven Farsi tweets, drawing 340,000 likes. Trump's message said: \"To the brave and suffering people of Iran: I have stood with you since the beginning of my presidency and my government will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely. Your courage is inspiring.\"\n\nTrump's January 11, 2020 Farsi tweet angered Iran's then-Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi, who responded the next day by tweeting : \"Hands and tongues smeared with threatening, sanctioning and terrorizing the #Iranian nation, are not entitled to dishonor the ancient #Persian_language.\"\n\nTrump also drew large audiences for English-language tweets pressuring Iran. His five most-liked Iran tweets in English, with 317,000 to 713,000 likes, were posted in January 2020, according to the Trump Twitter Archive. In the tweets, he hinted that Iran would face strong retaliation for military strikes on U.S. targets, vowed it will never have a nuclear weapon and warned it not to kill antigovernment protesters.\n\nEarlier in his presidency, Trump also drew international attention for a November 2, 2018 tweet of an image or meme of himself superimposed with the message \"SANCTIONS ARE COMING\".\n\nThe text of the meme used a font popularized by American fantasy drama TV series Game of Thrones to highlight Trump's imminent restoration of U.S. sanctions against Iran after he withdrew earlier in the year from a 2015 deal in which world powers offered Iran sanctions relief in return for limits on its nuclear program. Trump said the deal did not do enough to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, a goal Tehran denies having.\n\nNazenin Ansari, managing editor of Iranian news websites Kayhan London and Kayhan Life, told VOA Persian the Trump administration's social media outreach to Iranians built on Farsi social media channels that were created under the previous administration of Barack Obama.\n\n\"The Trump administration's social media messaging on Iran checked all the boxes by highlighting the Iranian public's grievances with the malign policy choices of the Islamic Republic,\" she said."}

The other 9 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump have also faced a backlash.\n\nCNN — House Republicans ousted Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming on Wednesday from her leadership post as conference chair after she repeatedly called out former President Donald Trump's \"Big Lie\" that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nThe move sends a high-profile message about the Republican Party's priorities, its ongoing loyalty to the former President and the limited extent to which it is willing to tolerate dissent even after Trump's election lies incited a deadly attack on the US Capitol.\n\nPrior to losing her leadership role, Cheney was the No. 3 House Republican and the highest-ranking of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for inciting an insurrection on January 6 when a violent pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol. The other nine House Republicans have also faced a backlash, including the threat of primary challenges over their impeachment votes as well as censure and calls for their resignation by state and local Republican groups.\n\nSome of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach, most notably Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, have continued to speak out about the \"Big Lie\" and the future of the Republican Party now that Trump is no longer in office. Others have taken a much lower profile approach since the impeachment vote, not frequently commenting publicly, if at all, on the direction the party is taking in the aftermath of the Trump presidency.\n\nHere's a (non-exhaustive) look at what has happened to the nine other House Republicans since they voted to impeach and the extent to which they have continued to speak out about the deep divisions within the party in the aftermath of January 6:\n\nAdam Kinzinger of Illinois\n\nAdam Kinzinger has been in the national spotlight often since his impeachment vote as a leading critic of the Republican Party's embrace of Trump's \"Big Lie\" and other conspiracy theories. Kinzinger has spoken out in support of Cheney and criticized the GOP over the push to remove her from leadership.\n\n\"You cannot unite with lies, if somebody is going to use lies to gain power and say, 'let's have unity,' you can't do it,\" Kinzinger said at an event earlier this week. \"'We need to remove Liz Cheney because she makes me have to answer questions that I know are false.' That's what they're saying.\"\n\nKinzinger said at the event that House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and Whip Steve Scalise \"decided that winning the next election was more important than a clear-eyed recognition of what happened on January 6.\"\n\n\"That was a lie that led to violence,\" he said.\n\nThe Illinois Republican recently launched a political action committee as part of an effort he's calling \"Country First\" that seeks to counter the GOP's embrace of conspiracy theories and the former President. The congressman has endorsed the nine other House Republicans who voted to impeach over the Capitol attack as they now face down the potential threat of primary challenges.\n\nHe also recently endorsed a Texas GOP congressional candidate, Michael Wood, who ran unsuccessfully in a crowded field on a platform calling for Republicans to turn away from Trump and reject conspiracy theories.\n\n\"I think what's important is that people see there are people out there that support you, that will back you if you do the right thing,\" Kinzinger told CNN of the endorsement. \"It's a long-term battle for the soul of the party.\"\n\nKinzinger has been censured by several county GOP organizations in Illinois and drawn a pro-Trump primary challenger, Catalina Lauf, who has said she is running against him, arguing that he \"betrayed his constituents\" and criticizing his impeachment vote.\n\nJohn Katko of New York\n\nJohn Katko has faced criticism from local GOP leaders in his home state of New York as a result of his impeachment vote.\n\nIn the run-up to the vote to oust Cheney, Katko said that if there was a vacancy for the leadership post of House GOP conference chair he would support GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, another New York lawmaker who now appears poised to be elevated to the position.\n\n\"I have every confidence that Elise will be a superb leader for all of our conference, not just some,\" Katko told The Auburn Citizen, though he also called Cheney \"a good friend.\"\n\nThe congressman has stood by his impeachment vote, telling CNN in February, \"Hell no,\" when asked if he had any regrets over the vote to impeach Trump.\n\nFred Upton of Michigan\n\nFred Upton has also faced rebukes from Republicans at the state level following his impeachment vote.\n\nBack in his home state of Michigan, the Allegan County Republican Party censured Upton for his vote, saying that he betrayed his \"oath of office and core values\" of the county party.\n\nThe Cass County Republican Party also censured the congressman over the impeachment vote."}

In Louisiana, one person died in floodwaters and one was killed by a falling tree.\n\nIn Slidell, Louisiana, crews were searching for a 71-year-old man whose wife said he was attacked by an alligator in the floodwaters.

A crane was brought in to lift them out of the hole.\n\nWDSU-TV reported that state troopers, emergency workers and rescue teams responded to Highway 26 west of Lucedale, about 60 miles north-east of Biloxi, to find both the east and westbound lanes collapsed. Robertson said the hole was about 50ft to 60ft long and 20ft to 30ft deep.\n\nThe identities and conditions of those who survived the accident were not immediately released.\n\nMore than 8in of rain fell in the area during Ida, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIda blasted ashore on Sunday as a category 4 storm, one of the most powerful ever to hit the US mainland, knocking out power, blowing roofs off buildings and reversing the flow of the Mississippi River.\n\nIn Mississippi's south-western corner, entire neighbourhoods were surrounded by floodwaters and many roads were impassable. Several tornadoes were reported, including a suspected twister in Saraland, Alabama, that ripped part of the roof off a motel and flipped an 18-wheeler, injuring the driver.\n\nJoe Biden met virtually on Monday with Mississippi's governor, Tate Reeves, along with Louisiana's Edwards, and mayors from cities and parishes most affected by Hurricane Ida. The president received an update on the storm's impact and discussed how the federal government can provide assistance.\n\n\"We are closely coordinating with state and local officials every step of the way,\" Biden said.\n\nOn Tuesday the remnants of Hurricane Ida dumped rain from Gulf coast states into New England.\n\nWeakened to a tropical depression with top sustained winds of 30mph, Ida was centered over northern Mississippi and Tennessee. The NWS said flash flooding was most likely in central Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia and western Maryland, where 6in to 10in could fall.\n\nForecasters also warned of higher wind gusts, and said Ida was most likely to spawn tornadoes in eastern Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida Panhandle.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasters have identified a new storm system out to sea. Kate was loosely organized and should remain far from shore in the central Atlantic, the US National Hurricane Center in Miami reported. Forecasters said another tropical depression was forming off the coast of Africa, blowing across the Atlantic a couple of hundred miles west-south-west of the coast of Guinea."}

The bill now goes to the Senate where its future was uncertain.\n\nThe solid number of Republicans voting for the independent investigation -- 35 out of 211 -- signaled some cracks in the party's defense of Trump on a key vote. Trump opposes the creation of a commission.\n\nAll 10 of the House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in January voted for the commission.\n\nThe bipartisan outcome could give Senate Republicans second thoughts about working to defeat the initiative.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Democrat, said McCarthy \"got what he asked for\" in a compromise on the structure of the commission, which would be charged with wrapping up its investigation by Dec. 31. McCarthy is a close ally of Trump.\n\nEarlier in the day, McConnell announced he would not support the House bill, calling it \"the House Democrats' slanted and unbalanced proposal\" and saying existing congressional investigations are sufficient.\n\nIn the 50-50 Senate - controlled by Democrats only because Vice President Kamala Harris can cast tie-breaking votes - Republicans can block the legislation. At least 60 votes are needed to advance most bills.\n\n\"There will continue to be no shortage of robust investigations,\" said McConnell, who in January said that the mob that attacked the Capitol was \"fed lies\" and \"provoked\" by Trump and others.\n\nPELOSI'S BACKUP PLAN\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said she could launch regular committee hearings with \"full subpoena power\" to investigate the riot if Senate Republicans block the commission.\n\n\"But that's not the path we have chosen to go,\" Pelosi added, explaining that a bipartisan, outside investigation was needed to win the public's trust in any findings.\n\nThe 10-member commission would produce a public report including recommendations for preventing another Capitol attack. It would be charged with examining security and intelligence failures surrounding the riot in which Trump's supporters, after he delivered an incendiary speech, interrupted the formal congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the November election.\n\nDuring debate, Republican Representative John Katko said, \"An independent 9/11-style review is critical for removing the politics around Jan. 6.\"\n\nKatko helped craft the legislation with House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat.\n\nThe House bill, unveiled last week, would give Republicans equal power with Democrats in appointing commissioners and equal say over witnesses.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he will schedule a debate on the legislation. Schumer accused Republican leaders of \"caving to Donald Trump and proving that the Republican Party is still drunk off the Big Lie\" that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was stolen from Trump through massive voter fraud."}

(AP) — Trashed on social media and censured by Louisiana Republicans, U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy described himself Wednesday as \"at peace\" with his vote to convict former President Donald Trump at his impeachment trial and dismissed the scorching GOP backlash he's received.\n\nLouisiana's senior Republican senator said he does not believe the criticism represents the feelings of many of his party's voters. He said the censure he received from the leadership of the state Republican Party represented \"a small group of people,\" not the \"broader Republican Party.\"\n\n\"I am such at peace with that vote. I say that knowing that I'm getting criticized, but I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution,\" Cassidy said in a conference call with reporters on a variety of topics.\n\nCassidy joined six other Senate Republicans in voting with Democrats on Feb. 13 to convict Trump of inciting the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol in an impeachment trial that saw the former president acquitted. Louisiana's other U.S. senator, Republican John Kennedy, voted against conviction.\n\n\"I've received comments from folks who are Republican who object to the vote,\" Cassidy said. \"I've received a heck of a lot of folks who agree with me or, if they don't agree with me, respect the kind of thought process that went into it.\"\n\nHe added: \"There's a diversity of opinion among Louisiana Republicans, even if there is not among a very small group of people.\"\n\nThough the 57-43 Senate vote was short of the two-thirds majority needed to find Trump guilty, the seven GOP votes against Trump represented the largest number of lawmakers to ever vote to find a president of their own party guilty at impeachment proceedings.\n\nSome Republicans who voted to acquit Trump said they did not believe the Democrats proved their case that the former president was directly responsible for inciting hundreds of people to storm the Capitol building in a riot that left five people dead. Other Republicans said they simply did not believe Congress had jurisdiction over a president no longer in office.\n\nCassidy has tried to change the conversation since the impeachment trial ended, sending out daily statements about a variety of subjects and talking about other issues, such as the confirmation hearings of President Joe Biden's cabinet appointments and recovery from the icy weather.\n\nBut Trump supporters don't want to move on, and they've been slamming Cassidy on conservative talk radio and websites. They've called for Republicans to ban Cassidy from their events, and several local Republican groups have joined the executive committee of the state GOP in condemning Cassidy's vote to convict Trump."}

A \"misfire\" does not result in a gun firing but the opposite: it doesn't fire at all.\n\nSecondly, it isn't an \"accident\" when you point a loaded handgun at someone and pull the trigger. In real life, it's assault with a deadly weapon to intentionally point a firearm at someone, loaded or not. In the context of a movie, it's irresponsible and negligent.\n\nWe also reacted to the word \"prop\" being used to describe the firearm itself. To us—and to most people, I'd guess—a prop is a rubber, wood or even metal representation of a firearm but is not an actual, functioning weapon that is capable of firing real ammunition that can maim or kill. A prop-gun is a realistic-looking toy that movies use to play make-believe for the camera. If a Bengal tiger had been on the movie set and mauled two people, one of them fatally, would anyone call it a \"prop tiger\"?\n\nIn just a matter of days, contradictory details emerged. The gun wasn't a toy but an actual firearm. The police have seized some 500 rounds of various types of ammunition from the set including blanks, dummy rounds and live ammunition. At least three people appear to have handled the pistol before it was fired, including the armorer hired to safely handle these weapons, an assistant director, and Baldwin himself. This means there were three chances to make sure the firearm was not loaded with live ammunition.\n\nAs far as we know, the film's 24-year-old head armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, had no special training or licenses to ensure she was qualified (beyond whatever she may have been taught by her father, a well-known Hollywood armorer). By contrast, if animals are used in a movie, the set is closely supervised by an American Humane Society Certified Animal Safety Representative who oversees the treatment of the animals. Movie companies get their scripts approved by the AHS in advance and they sign off on the credentials of any animal handlers assigned to the film, which often include veterinarians. In exchange for following these practices, producers are permitted by AHS to say in the credits, \"No animals were harmed in the production of this film.\"\n\nSo while Hollywood is very serious about the safe handling of animals on the set and the safety of the crew around those animals, this is not the case with guns. There are guidelines covering basic rules of safety issued by studios on how to treat firearms. Under the \"Safety on the Set\" category for Warner Brothers Studios website, they even type them all in capital letters so you know they really mean business.\n\nThere is such a thing as a \"Licensed Armorer\" for movie companies but that license comes from their union, not any state agency or organization specifically engaged in firearms safety training."}

The White House's massive $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus and rapidly improving public health are unleashing pent-up demand.\n\n\"While we aren't completely out of the woods yet, today's report shows the beginning of an economic rebound,\" said Brendan Coughlin, head of consumer banking at Citizens in Boston. \"Assuming no setback in the continued rollout of the vaccines, U.S. consumers are well-positioned in the second half of the year to stimulate strong economic growth across the country.\"\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 4.2% last month after falling 1.0% in February, the Commerce Department said. The increase was broadly in line with economists' expectations.\n\nThe data was included in Thursday's gross domestic product report for the first quarter, which showed growth shooting up at a 6.4% annualized rate in the first three months of the year after rising at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending powered ahead at a 10.7% rate last quarter.\n\nMost Americans in the middle- and low-income brackets received one-time $1,400 stimulus checks last month which were part of the pandemic rescue package approved in March. That boosted personal income 21.1% after a drop of 7.0% in February.\n\nA chunk of the cash was stashed away, with the saving rate soaring to 27.6% from 13.9% in February. Households have amassed at least $2.2 trillion in excess savings, which could provide a powerful tailwind for consumer spending this year and beyond.\n\nThe government's generosity and expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination program to include all American adults is lifting consumer spirits, with a measure of household sentiment rising to a 13-month high in April.\n\nWages are also increasing, which should to help to underpin spending when stimulus boost fades.\n\nIn a separate report on Friday, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, jumped 0.9% in the first quarter. That was the largest rise since the second quarter of 2007.\n\nThe ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes. Last quarter's increase was driven by a 1.0% rise in wages, also the biggest gain in 14 years.\n\nWages in the accommodation and food services industry, hardest hit by the pandemic, soared 1.7%.\n\nDespite employment being 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020, businesses are struggling to find qualified workers as they rush to meet the robust domestic demand.\n\nU.S. stocks were lower after a recent rally.

And it came at a time when she will provide Democrats the edge with her tiebreaking vote.\n\nHarris' ascent to the vice presidency, combined with the swearing-in of her appointed Senate replacement, Alex Padilla of California, and newly elected Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, made New York's Charles E. Schumer the Senate majority leader.\n\nLike President Joe Biden when he was vice president, Harris will have a variety of largely ceremonial functions as president of the Senate, but she may also find herself doing something Biden never did.\n\nThe 50-50 party split in the Senate puts her in a somewhat similar position to her most recent predecessor, Mike Pence, who was on the West Front of the Capitol for Wednesday's inaugural ceremony. He cast 13 tiebreaking votes over his four-year term, in part because of recent changes in Senate rules on nominations.\n\nHarris' new tiebreaking power also led to Vermont Democrat Patrick J. Leahy resuming the position of Senate president pro tempore, with the constitutional role to fulfill the Senate duties of the vice president when she is not in the Capitol.\n\nIn their opening floor statements following Leahy's election, which came by unanimous consent, both Schumer and Republican leader Mitch McConnell congratulated Biden and Harris and praised the celebration of democracy that took place Wednesday. But neither spoke to the details of the effort to formally organize the Senate, which is the most pressing piece of business.\n\nSchumer and McConnell continue to iron out the terms of the amount of power to be provided the minority party. Any agreement will likely echo the 2001 deal that resulted from the last time the Senate was tied: Democrats will chair committees and Schumer will have control of the floor, but there will be equal membership on committees.\n\n\"This Senate will legislate. It will be active, responsive, energetic and bold. And to my Republican colleagues, when and where we can, the Democratic majority will strive to make this important work bipartisan,\" Schumer said on the floor.\n\n\"Our country deserves for both sides, both parties, to find common ground for the common good everywhere that we can and disagree respectfully where we must,\" McConnell said in his first speech since returning to minority leader status. \"Last fall, the American people chose to elect a narrowly divided House of Representatives, a 50-50 Senate and a president who promised unity.\"\n\nFor those looking for signs of such bipartisanship, there was one Wednesday. The chamber, even without a formal organizing resolution, confirmed Biden's nominee to be director of national intelligence, Avril Haines.\n\nThe 84-10 vote came after a brief hiccup when Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., placed a hold on the nomination until he received a response regarding comments Haines made during her confirmation hearing Tuesday."}

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The coronavirus pandemic has triggered permanent shifts in how and where people work. Businesses are planning for a future where more people are working from home, traveling less for business, or replacing workers with robots. All of these modifications mean many workers will not be able to do the same job they did before the pandemic, even after much of the U.S. population gets vaccinated against the deadly virus.\n\nMicrosoft founder-turned-philanthropist Bill Gates raised eyebrows in November when he predicted that half of business travel and 30 percent of \"days in the office\" would go away forever. That forecast no longer seems far-fetched. In a report coming out later this week that was previewed to The Washington Post, the McKinsey Global Institute says that 20 percent of business travel won't come back and about 20 percent of workers could end up working from home indefinitely. These shifts mean fewer jobs at hotels, restaurants and downtown shops, in addition to ongoing automation of office support roles and some factory jobs.\n\n\"We're recovering, but to a different economy,\" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell said in November.\n\nThe nation's unemployed are starting to react to these big shifts. Two-thirds of the jobless say they have seriously considered changing their occupation or field of work, according to the Pew Research Center. That is a significant increase from the Great Recession era, when 52 percent said they were considering such a change.\n\n\"We think that there is a very real scenario in which a lot of the large employment, low-wage jobs in retail and in food service just go away in the coming years,\" said Susan Lund, head of the McKinsey Global Institute. \"It means that we're going to need a lot more short-term training and credentialing programs.\"\n\nKelly Evans lost her job during the pandemic, but has never received unemployment. As her family battles hunger, she hopes Washington acts quickly on relief. (Video: Ashleigh Joplin, Zoeann Murphy/The Washington Post)\n\nOne problem for many unemployed people is they lack the money to retrain. This crisis has put many out of work for nearly a year, and the financial support from unemployment and food stamps is often not sufficient to pay their bills. The stimulus legislation being debated in Congress does not include any money for retraining.\n\n\"Trying to figure out what to do six months from now is hard when you are trying to make ends meet and you don't have enough food,\" said Brad Hershbein, who helps design and study retraining programs as a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.\n\nTake Serena Couch, who lost her job at Disney World in Orlando in April. She initially held out hope that she would be called back, but as the months went by, it became clear that that was unlikely. Now the 27-year-old has started spending her days looking for jobs and trying to learn to code by watching YouTube videos and reading blogs.\n\n\"I'm trying to learn coding on my own, because that's what everyone says to do when you're in this position,\" said Couch, who receives about $500 a month in jobless benefits, not enough to pay bills. \"I can't afford to pay for a program, so I'm just doing free programs online.\"\n\nCouch and her boyfriend, who is also laid off from a theme park, moved in with a relative to save money, and her car was repossessed around Christmas. Couch said she never intended to make a career in the hospitality industry, but without a college degree, she thought her job options were limited.\n\n\"We haven't been able to find anything that makes nearly as much as that Disney job,\" Couch said.\n\nIndeed, the number of workers in need of retraining could be in the millions, according to McKinsey and David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who co-wrote a report warning that automation is accelerating in the pandemic. He predicts far fewer jobs in retail, rest, car dealerships and meatpacking facilities.\n\n\"Once robots are in place, we won't go back. Once you've made that type of capital investment, you don't tend to go backward,\" Autor said. In the report he wrote, \"These developments were sure to happen over the longer run. But the crisis has pulled them forward in time.\"\n\nAutomation of jobs often speeds up during recessions, as companies look to cut costs and use periods of layoffs to experiment with new technologies. Some economists predict that there could be more automation now, because the pandemic forced companies to look for ways to minimize the number of employees in a workspace and the vast scale of the layoffs in the economy gives executives a unique opportunity to bring in robots."}

And for the first time in seven years, the national gas price average reached $3 a gallon.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident highlights the huge fallout cyberattacks can have on the country's critical infrastructure and raises new questions about why the U.S. is so vulnerable to such crippling strikes.\n\nExperts say ransomware attacks, in particular, have been on the rise because of how easily they can be deployed, carried out by actors ranging from enemy nations to criminal gangs.\n\n\"Cybersecurity is a problem because the cyber vulnerabilities can be exploited by very small groups with small amounts of funding, it is the ultimate asymmetric threat,\" Tom Bossert, homeland security adviser under President Donald Trump told ABC News.\n\nThe FBI said Monday that ransomware from DarkSide, a criminal organization that operates in Eastern Europe, was responsible for the Colonial Pipeline network attack.\n\nWhile federal officials were still trying to determine whether a foreign nation could be involved, Russian intelligence has been known to cooperate with Eastern European cybercriminals in the past.\n\nPrevention, Bossert said, involves remembering human beings are behind the attacks.\n\n\"We need better technical solutions on that as a group or part of a group of people trying to develop innovative solutions for better technology to prevent attacks, but there's got to be a government role in stopping the human beings that are doing the attacking,\" Bossert explained.\n\nFormer Assistant Secretary for Homeland Security Elizabeth Neumann, an ABC News contributor, said companies and governments need to keep pace with the growing security threat.\n\n\"There's a lot more we can be doing with our critical infrastructure,\" Neumann said. \"More of these systems are being digitized. Things that used to be manually operated are now being operated by computers and that of course creates vulnerability. The infrastructure in of itself is very expensive. A lot of it is decades old ... because they are so underfunded, they tend to not update their IT very often.\"\n\nNeumann said the impact of future cyberattacks could be much more severe, particularly if a foreign adversary is involved.\n\nAnother expert told ABC News that such a large-scale ransomware attack was only a matter of time, given the uptick and lack of cybersecurity coordination between private companies and the government, a key point in the executive order President Joe Biden signed Wednesday evening.\n\n\"It was inevitable that we would reach a point where one of these attacks would have significant economic damage,\" Dmitri Alperovitch, the executive chairman at Silverado Policy Accelerator and a former CTO of CrowdStrike, said.\n\nHackers can successfully infiltrate a system's computer network and deploy malicious software to effectively seize control, holding hostage files or data until a ransom is paid.\n\n\"Many of these ransom operations are more about extortion than ransomware where they will steal data -- typically emails -- and threaten their release and try to embarrass companies and hopefully find -- from their perspective -- find something that these companies will really want to keep quiet, whether it's intellectual property or information on customers,\" Alperovitch said, \"and that would increase the likelihood of actually getting ransom.\"\n\nThe boom in ransomware, he said, coincides with the boom in cryptocurrency."}

The announcement of the increase in fees comes as the canal has been experiencing record traffic.\n\nRates for vessels transiting the canal will be increased by six percent beginning in February 2022. While the canal has benefitted dramatically from the increase in shipping volumes and the transit of new larger vessels, it has nonetheless also found itself facing increasing competition. During the spring blockage shipping lines elected to send some of their vessels around Africa while Russia heavily promoted the advantages of its North Sea Route. The Panama Canal has also been seeking to increase traffic offering increasing the competition with its tolls.\n\nAdmiral Osama Rabea, Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, said in considering the rate increases they carefully followed and scrutinized all the variables related to the shipping market, global economic indicators, and global trade movement. He said that they seek to apply a balanced and flexible marketing and pricing strategy that fulfills the authority and its clients' interests and takes into account the global economic conditions. The rate hike was balanced with International Monitory Fund and World Trade organization projections for global economic growth while allowing them to provide navigational services for transiting through the canal. He also compared their services to other competitive routes.\n\nThe Canal Authority, however, said that it would exempt both LNG carriers and cruise ships from the increase in tariffs. The canal has seen a continuous seaborne trade for LNG but it is a very competitive market. During October, 84 LNG carriers transited the canal up from 46 the prior year with an 87 percent increase in tonnage. Going forward, the Authority is modifying rates for LNG carriers from 25 percent to 15 percent starting this month.\n\nCruise ships, they said, had been the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the efforts are designed to support a restoration of the traffic. Similarly, the Panama Canal Authority is also considering proposals to adjust the rates for cruise ships to also support their return.\n\nThe decision to raise the tariffs came after the Suez Canal set a new record for transits during October. The number of ships was up 14 percent year-over-year with a total of 1,847 transits. Net tonnage was up more than 11 percent to 112.1 million tons contributing to a 12 percent increase in revenues to over $551.1 million.\n\nThe Suez Canal recorded its highest ever daily transits on September 29, 2021. A total of 87 vessels made the passage totaling 4.8 million net tons. During the day, a total of 49 vessels were northbound while 38 made the southbound transit.\n\nDuring the first ten months of 2021, the Canal saw a nearly nine percent increase in tonnage. A total of 17,020 ships made the trip versus 1,380 in the first 10 months of 2020."}

(AP) — Before he became the object of fury of Republicans for voting to convict Donald Trump during the former president's second impeachment trial, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania was once the insurgent from the right.\n\nIt is now Toomey facing angry rank-and-file state Republican Party committee members and the potential of a censure vote, a symbolic gesture that may have no real effect on the senator since he isn't seeking reelection next year.\n\nToomey, who once endorsed challenges to Republican officeholders who weren't seen as conservative enough, is now urging Republicans to be tolerant of a difference of opinion over whether Trump and his long campaign of falsehoods to discredit the election result is to blame for the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"I understand that most Republicans probably disagree with the conclusion that I came to,\" Toomey said during a Thursday radio appearance on WPHT-AM in Philadelphia. \"I don't think it's a good idea for the party to be deciding that they're going to censure a particular elected Republican over a particular vote, and I think it sends a bad message to the many Republicans, even if they're in the minority, the many Republicans who do agree with what I've done here.\"\n\nToomey last Saturday became one of seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump of \"incitement of insurrection,\" even though the vote to convict ultimately fell 10 votes short of the two-thirds majority, or 67, necessary in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe state GOP chair, Lawrence Tabas, promptly emailed state party committee members to tell them he was planning a meeting to discuss the Senate's action.\n\nThat meeting — if it happens — is expected to involve a censure resolution, as a wave of county parties have already voted to censure Toomey."}

Well, already, two of the Rust EPs are wiping their hands clean of the situation.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the now shuttered production, Allen Cheney made it known in a statement provided to the press Wednesday that he, along with Emily Salveson and her Streamline Global finance company, \"received Executive Producer credit on the film Rust having no involvement with the physical and day to day production,\" which is \"consistent with financing partners across productions of all sizes.\"\n\n(L-R) DP Halyna Hutchins on left who was died on set of 'Rust', director/writer Joel Souza who was injured and star/producer Alec Baldwin ICFC; Mega\n\nCheney further defended the experience of the producers of the production, which saw Baldwin on October 21 discharge a long Colt .45 revolver during a \"quick draw\" rehearsal, with a \"live round\" striking Hutchins and director Joel Souza, according to police. Baldwin, who also serves as a producer on Rust, was informed by First Assistant Director Dave Halls that he had been given what's known as a \"cold gun.\" That was not the case, as the death of Hutchins and injuring of the film's director Joel Souza in the shoulder that afternoon tragically revealed.\n\n\"The six credited producers on the independent film Rust, Ryan Smith, Alec Baldwin, Nathan Klingher, Ryan Winterstern, Matt DelPiano and Anjul Nigam, collectively have more than 35 years' experience producing small to mid-level film and television projects,\" said Cheney's statement.\n\n\"Rust is a union-certified production, in good standing with all of the major production unions and guilds, including IATSE, the Teamsters, SAG, and DGA,\" said Cheney. IATSE has ripped Rust for hiring non-union crew when the camera team walked out.\n\nA rusted chain hangs on the fence at the entrance to the Bonanza Creek Ranch film set in Santa Fe, N.M., AP\n\nIn the aftermath of the killing of Hutchins, many have tried to sort out who is financially responsible for the oversee of a production that allegedly cut a number of corners.\n\nHere's what we've parsed out so far.\n\nFirst and foremost, Bondit Media Capital did not have any equity stake in Rust, despite being named a co-financier. We've learned that the production finance lender, whose feature credits include the upcoming Bruce Willis-John Travolta re-team Paradise City, loaned money to production against distribution collateral. Bondit did not respond for comment on this story.\n\nRust was not bonded. Two of the three U.S. completion bond firms were approached about bonding the project, according to sources, but it didn't happen. In one of the two cases, a potential financier made inquiries with one and stepped back from the film when the company declined to issue a bond.\n\nBondit generally does not require completion bonds to lend and has been active in getting productions up and running during Covid.\n\nBonds are like super-insurance, with the bond company on the hook for costs if a film isn't delivered in time and on budget. Productions also have traditional insurance, in Rust's case said to be from Chubb, which declined to comment."}

Usually an armorer, they're very serious people and they're very committed and the guns are checked,\" Lundgren said.\n\nLundgren pointed out that \"it's been 35 years\" since he attempted to wrap his mind around a similar tragedy. His former co-star, Brandon Lee, the son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, was killed by a prop gun while filming \"The Crow\" in 1993.\n\n\"Any other time I remember it happened was with Brandon Lee,\" Lundgren, a former karate champion, recalled.\n\nHILARIA BALDWIN'S INSTAGRAM POSTS RAISE EYEBROWS AS INVESTIGATION INTO 'RUST' SHOOTING CONTINUES\n\n\"It's crazy,\" Lundgren continued of the \"Rust\" tragedy. \"I don't know how that happened.

Still, if his successful career as taught him anything thus far, it's that there are several protocols taken to ensure gun safety is a top priority.\n\n\"I used to do a couple dry fires into the ground before I use it. There is a protocol that is pretty strict and I'm sure safety on sets is going to be even more [strict] now,\" the action icon added.\n\nThe Swedish actor is gearing up for the upcoming release of \"Castle Falls,\" which he stars in and directed.

That's probably why they opted for using blanks.\"\n\nBaldwin was handed a Colt revolver by assistant director Dave Halls while rehearsing a scene for the indie-western. He fired the gun, which was somehow loaded with a live round that discharged, killing Hutchins.\n\nA day after the shooting, Baldwin publicly vowed to aid in any way he can in the Santa Fe Police Department investigation into the matter that left a grieving husband and father along with a 9-year-old son in bereavement. He also had an emotional meeting with Hutchins' family in the hours after the shooting."}

Fahed Alfalahi headed home from his precinct in Queens.\n\nHe'd heard about the storm, of course, but he could have never imagined that his commute home to Pelham would find him shivering in water up to the SUV's steering wheel as floodwaters turned Wolfs Lane into a churning extension of the Hutchinson River.\n\nHurricane Ida was an expected storm that brought about the deadly unexpected across the Hudson Valley, with a death toll at 10 and counting in New York, including one confirmed death in Westchester, an unidentified man in Elmsford.\n\nAs the storm walloped the region, cellphones chimed with flash-flood warnings and alerts and even a tornado warning for New York City.\n\nBefore long, roads became rivers and rivers overtook roads. Police and fire dispatchers worked to handle hundreds of calls for crews to perform water rescues in places where there should be no water.\n\nOn the Yonkers-Bronxville line, the Sprain Brook Parkway was strewn with cars abandoned by their drivers, sitting in water up to their door handles and higher.\n\nIn Rockland County, floodwaters force the New York State Thruway to close in both directions, the highway not high enough.\n\nRain fell in buckets: nearly 9 inches in Mount Kisco; more than 6 inches in Wappingers Falls; nearly 6 in Vails Gate in Orange County; more than 5 inches in Suffern. In Ulster County, Wallkill saw more than 6 inches of rain.\n\nIn Pelham, all that rain ended up in the Hutchinson River and the Hutchinson River ended up on Wolfs Lane, right where Fared Alfalahi's SUV was, nearly home.\n\nHe really thought he could make it.\n\nWhen the smaller car in front of him forged into the standing water, Alfalahi followed. After all, his SUV was larger. But the car in front stopped. And Alfalahi stopped. Then his engine stalled and would not start again.\n\nHe stopped in the glow of a stoplight, the wind whipping the rain in sheets.\n\nHe opened the door and water rushed in, colder than he would have thought. It continued to rush in, even after he shut the door. Before he knew it, the floodwaters had reached the steering wheel.\n\nHe opened the window and climbed up to stand in the open space, to figure out his next step, which would be a wet one no matter where he took it.\n\nAcross the street, Cindy Finegan was watching. She had seen rain in her 15 years on Wolfs Lane, but nothing like this. Even Superstorm Sandy — the benchmark of all benchmarks for storms — hadn't been like this, she thought.\n\nLiving in a flood zone, Finegan and her neighbors are ready. Their houses have French drains and high-powered sump pumps. They know not to finish their basements, to keep things they treasure upstairs, lest the Hutchinson River overtop its banks and render it all, sodden, to the dumpster.\n\nStill, they watch rainy forecasts warily.\n\nBut what Finegan saw out her window was the raging Hutchinson River everywhere she looked, sweeping cars down Wolfs Lane.\n\nShe and her family helped three people who were trapped in their cars.\n\nDrone video of the Bronx River and Sprain Brook Parkway after the flood Drone video of the Bronx River and Sprain Brook Parkway after the flood John Meore and Peter Carr, Rockland/Westchester Journal News\n\nThen she saw the man balancing himself, standing in the window of his SUV, battered by wind and rain.

The river surrounded Finegan's neighbors' homes and found its way into their basements through closed windows, leaving 8 to 10 feet of water, she said. It was like the water was coming up through the tile and grout, she said.\n\nBut that was downstairs. At the moment, Finegan was looking at the man swimming across her street, and walking, wading home.\n\nWhen someone asked for directions to help a sick woman get to New Rochelle, the driver saw that Alfalahi was shivering and offered to give him a ride. They found closed roads at every turn and, eventually, the tired detective ended up walking home after sending them on their way.\n\nWhen he walked in his door, it was 11 p.m. He was waterlogged and shivering.\n\nThe next day, Thursday, Alfala was back on Wolfs Lane, waiting for a tow truck, when Finegan walked over to talk to the man who had swam. This being 2021, she showed him the photo she had taken of him, contemplating his next soggy step. She got his number, and texted it to him.\n\nBecause who would believe a guy who says he swam across the street, if he didn't have proof?\n\nThe day after\n\nAcross the Hudson Valley, those residents who were able to sleep overnight Wednesday — those not kept awake anxiously watching the floodwaters near their houses, to their houses, into their houses — woke Thursday to a bright blue sky reflected in the murky remains of Ida.

Check the mail for a debit card\n\nWashington CNN — Still haven't received your $600 stimulus payment? Check the mail for a debit card.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service sent out more than 100 million payments in January, which were approved by Congress late last year. The vast majority of payments were directly deposited into personal bank accounts, but others are receiving either a paper check or prepaid debit card in the mail. About 8 million debit cards were sent out.\n\nLike the first round of payments, which were worth up to $1,200 per person and were sent out last spring, the agency is sending the payment in three different ways to help speed up the delivery process.\n\nLast year, some recipients mistakenly thought the debit cards were junk mail. The Internal Revenue Service is warning people to keep a careful eye on the mail and that the form of payment may be different than the one received last year. Some people who received a paper check last time may now get a prepaid debit card. The new payment will not be added to any debit cards that were sent for the first round of payments.\n\nThe debit cards are being sent in a white envelope with the Treasury Department seal on the outside. The card itself is a Visa debit card issued by MetaBank, the Treasury's financial agent. It can be used to make purchases, to get cash at an ATM or to transfer funds into a bank account without being charged a fee.\n\nPeople can check to see whether their second payment has been sent by using the Internal Revenue Service's Get My Payment online tool. The law required the agency to stop delivering this round of payments. Eligible people who weren't sent their money by then will have to wait to claim it on their 2020 tax return.\n\nEligibility is largely based on income. Individuals earning less than $75,000 a year will receive the full $600. Heads of household earning less than $112,500 and married couples filing jointly earning less than $150,000 are also due the full amount. They will receive $600 per child under the age of 17, which is $100 more than in the first round.\n\nThe payments start phasing out for people making more money, at a rate of $5 per $100 of additional income. Some people who received the first payment may be phased out of the second round because the payments are smaller.\n\nThey will phase out entirely at $87,000 for single filers without children and $174,000 for those married filing jointly without children, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation.\n\nUndocumented immigrants who don't have Social Security numbers remain ineligible for the payments. But in a change from the first round, their spouses and children are now eligible as long as they have Social Security numbers.\n\nThose who are claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return, like some college students, remain ineligible."}

Nearly 2.9 billion users were not only inconvenienced, but many also lost a crucial means of communication in regions where WhatsApp is the primary method for text messaging and voice calls.\n\nIt was quickly discovered that the culprit was a faulty configuration change on Facebook's backbone routers that manage traffic between their data centers. A simple misconfiguration was propagated across their entire network that affected not only their users, but also impacted their own tools and systems, hindering Facebook's ability to diagnose and solve the problem.\n\nA more detailed account of the problem was later published by Facebook explaining the causes and how a routine maintenance task resulted in a complete and total service blackout. An incorrect command was sent to check capacity that inadvertently disabled Facebook's border gateway protocol (BGP) routers, effectively severing its datacenters from the internet. Adding to the problem was a bug in an audit tool that should have caught the mistake, but didn't, allowing it to be deployed live across their entire environment.\n\nWith the BGP routers offline, Facebook wasn't broadcasting the routes to DNS servers on their network. DNS servers are crucial internet components that act as phonebooks, taking a domain name like www.facebook.com and translating it into an IP address. Facebook's network has its own DNS servers that maintain the IP addresses for all its domains that are shared globally across the Internet. When a user tried to access any of Facebook's domains during the outage, they were met with errors that there was no destination address to direct them to.\n\nMisconfigurations are a Top Reason for Outages\n\n\" Through 2023, \"99% of firewall breaches will be\n\ncaused by misconfigurations, not firewalls.\"\n\nIt's long been known that human error is a top cause of network and service outages. Complex environments amplify the likelihood that mistakes will be made and their effects will be more far-reaching. Through the next several years, Gartner says that misconfiguration errors will be responsible for 99% of all firewall security breaches.\n\nIn a case like Facebook, the BGP routers were the critical point of failure to an otherwise healthy network. A small change to their configuration managed to sever their connections to the internet for hours.\n\nSecurity Policy Misconfigurations Can Be Worse\n\nAlthough disruptive, it's unlikely that any security event will result from Facebook's recent outage. However, that's not always the case. Time and again small changes have led to unintended security vulnerabilities, exposing organizations to the threat of attacks should they be found and exploited.\n\n→READ: Defining Firewall Change Management & Process Workflows\n\nNetwork security policy misconfigurations not only can lead to wide-scale outages, but also are one of the easiest ways to accidentally pave the way for devastating security breaches. The Capital One breach in 2019 was directly attributed to a misconfigured firewall that left one of their cloud servers vulnerable, allowing the hacker to access sensitive data for over 100 million customers.\n\nIdentify, Eliminate and Protect with FireMon\n\nFireMon gives you visibility into high-risk policies and vulnerabilities lurking in your infrastructure and prevents you from creating new ones before policies are deployed.

But there is a problem getting the fuel from refineries on the Gulf Coast to the states that need it, and officials are scrambling to find alternate routes to deliver that fuel.\n\nIf the pipeline shutdown extends past the weekend, it could create broader fuel disruptions.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline, which delivers about 45% of the fuel consumed on the East Coast, was hit on Friday with a cyberattack by hackers who lock up computer systems and demand a ransom to release them. The attack raised concerns, once again, about the vulnerability of the nation's critical infrastructure.\n\nThe pipeline runs from the Gulf Coast to the New York metropolitan region, but states in the Southeast are more reliant on the pipeline. Other parts of the country have more sources to tap. For example, a substantial amount of fuel is delivered to states in the Northeast by massive tankers.\n\n\"What you're feeling is not a lack of supply or a supply issue. What we have is a transportation issue,\" said Jeanette McGee, spokeswoman for the AAA auto club. \"There is ample supply to fuel the United States for the summer, but what we're having an issue with is getting it to those gas stations because the pipeline is down.\"\n\nJamar Gatison, 36, was filling up his tank in Norfolk, Virginia, Wednesday before a doctor's appointment.\n\n\"I'm about to run out of gas, so I have no choice,\" the construction worker said while waiting in line at a 7-Eleven. \"I'm also an Uber Eats driver. I also need gas for that,\" Gatison said, adding that he probably won't deliver food Wednesday night because he doesn't want to wait in line again while the shortage continues.\n\nIn North Carolina, 28% of gas stations were out of fuel, according to Gasbuddy.com, a technology firm that tracks real-time fuel prices across the country. In Raleigh-Durham it was worse, with 72% of gas stations out of fuel.

Bailey, M.D., immediate past president of the American Medical Association. \"With more than 300 million doses administered in the United States and nearly 4 billion doses administered worldwide, we know the vaccines are safe and highly effective at preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19. Increased vaccinations among health care personnel will not only reduce the spread of COVID-19 but also reduce the harmful toll this virus is taking within the health care workforce and those we are striving to serve.\"\n\nDue to the recent COVID-19 surge and the availability of safe and effective vaccines, our health care organizations and societies advocate that all health care and long-term care employers require their workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. This is the logical fulfillment of the ethical commitment of all health care workers to put patients as well as residents of long-term care facilities first and take all steps necessary to ensure their health and well-being.\n\nBecause of highly contagious variants, including the Delta variant, and significant numbers of unvaccinated people, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are once again rising throughout the United States1. Vaccination is the primary way to put the pandemic behind us and avoid the return of stringent public health measures.\n\nUnfortunately, many health care and long-term care personnel remain unvaccinated. As we move towards full FDA approval of the currently available vaccines, all health care workers should get vaccinated for their own health, and to protect their colleagues, families, residents of long-term care facilities and patients. This is especially necessary to protect those who are vulnerable, including unvaccinated children and the immunocompromised. Indeed, this is why many health care and long-term care organizations already require vaccinations for influenza, hepatitis B, and pertussis.\n\nWe call for all health care and long-term care employers to require their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nWe stand with the growing number of experts and institutions that support the requirement for universal vaccination of health workers2, 3. While we recognize some workers cannot be vaccinated because of identified medical reasons and should be exempted from a mandate, they constitute a small minority of all workers. Employers should consider any applicable state laws on a case-by-case basis.\n\nExisting COVID-19 vaccine mandates have proven effective4, 5. Simultaneously, we recognize the historical mistrust of health care institutions, including among many in our own health care workforce. We must continue to address workers' concerns, engage with marginalized populations, and work with trusted messengers to improve vaccine acceptance."}

The ban has slowed or altogether halted legal immigration from certain countries that the former administration deemed to be security threats, keeping families apart and even stymieing refugee resettlement.\n\nThe travel ban was Trump's first major action on immigration policy, setting the tone for the chaotic four years that followed for immigrants while galvanizing public opposition.\n\nWhen the ban was announced, it resulted in mass protests in airports across the US where people from the affected countries, which were initially limited to those with majority-Muslim populations, were held for questioning for hours.\n\nThis led immigrant advocates to call it a discriminatory \"Muslim ban,\" citing Trump's campaign promise to establish a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" Democrats in Congress, who for years had expressed conflicting positions on immigration policy, coalesced in opposition to the policy, using it to present a united front in condemnation of the xenophobia it represented.\n\nThe ban was amended several times in the face of numerous court challenges arguing that Trump did not have the legal authority to issue it and that it unlawfully discriminated against Muslims. The third version of the ban, ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court, barred citizens of seven countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela, and North Korea — from obtaining any kind of visas, largely preventing them from entering the US. (Chad was taken off the list of countries subject to the ban in April 2019 after it met the Trump administration's demands to share information with US authorities that could aid in efforts to vet foreigners.)"}

As The Washington Post reported Thursday, Cuomo participated in official strategy sessions with political advisers guiding his brother, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D), on how to respond to sexual-harassment allegations.\n\nZucker had tolerated other missteps by his increasingly controversial prime-time star. But this time, he informed Cuomo that he had crossed a line. And he urged him to go on TV to explain himself.\n\nIn some ways, it was a classic move on the part of Zucker, a veteran of NBC's entertainment division during the rise of reality TV, to capitalize on some behind-the-scenes drama by turning it into programming. (His conversation with Cuomo was described by people familiar with the exchange who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations at CNN.) Yet it also tracked with CNN's by now well-established policy of how to deal with the roiling, inherent conflict of the Cuomo brother dynamic — essentially by embracing it.\n\nAnd even as many CNN employees griped privately about Cuomo's decision to insert himself into his brother's political operation, by early this week it seemed likely that he would survive this controversy, too, in large part because of Zucker's unwavering support.\n\nAt a town hall meeting for staff members Tuesday, Zucker acknowledged the concerns about Cuomo's seemingly untouchable status at CNN while defending his decision not to punish him by taking him off the air.\n\n\"There is no one else in Chris's shoes,\" Zucker told the staff, referring to the newsman's unique identity as the brother of a major newsmaker. \"There are not special rules for Chris, and it does not excuse his mistake. It was more powerful and more honest to publicly say he screwed up and for him to publicly acknowledge his mistake.\"\n\nAs the anchor of one of the nighttime hours that cable news has increasingly ceded to opinion, Cuomo also has more latitude to venture into personal expression than traditional news-deliverers — part of CNN's justification for his jovial, soft-focus segments interviewing the governor during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nYet the revelation that Cuomo had taken on the role of political adviser brings CNN ever more uncomfortably into the kind of partisanship adopted by conservative rival Fox News Channel, whose prime-time hosts regularly counseled Donald Trump during his presidency.\n\n\"It baffles many of us inside why the network seems to exempt Chris from so many of the good limitations that journalists should adhere to,\" said one of CNN's on-air journalists, speaking on the condition of anonymity to criticize colleagues."}

Northeastern's doctor was speaking in general terms about the nature of the golfer's state of mind and his outlook, post-surgery.\n\nCorrado describes Woods's injuries as \"debilitating\" and \"serious\" and warns it will be a long recovery ahead. No one can know for sure at this point how he will bounce back, and Woods may not ever return to championship golf form. Beyond his physical condition, another concern is the mental and emotional toll he will experience from being away from the sport that he revolutionized, Corrado says.\n\n\"For someone like Tiger, or even for our athletes, they have defined themselves by their sport for the entirety of their lives,\" he says. \"Some are very graceful about that, and some are not.\"\n\nCorrado says a danger for Woods is the temptation to abuse drugs and alcohol again. Woods pleaded guilty in 2017 to reckless driving and agreed to enter a diversion program that would wipe his record clean.\n\nHe had Vicodin, Dilaudid, Xanax, Ambien, and THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) in his system when he was arrested at that time on suspicion of driving under the influence, according to a toxicology report obtained by ESPN.\n\n\"The most important thing for him mentally is he doesn't spiral back down into substance abuse,\" says Corrado.\n\nLaw enforcement authorities on the scene of this week's crash said they checked for any odor of alcohol or other signs Woods was under the influence of a substance and found none, according to media reports.\n\n\"This is purely an accident,\" Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva was quoted as saying.\n\nPost-surgery, Woods's focus should be on emotional healing, advises Dan Boothby, who oversees Northeastern's staff of athletic trainers, physical therapists, and strength-and-conditioning coaches.\n\nStaying positive after weeks of inactivity will be challenging for Woods, as it would be for any other elite athlete. \"The emotional piece is such an important part of it because that promotes physical healing,\" he says.\n\nTalk of a return to the links and the high level of play for which Woods was known is superseded by more pressing issues, Boothby adds. \"The fact that he's alive, the fact that there wasn't more significant injury, that's got to be the focus,\" he says.\n\nOnce Woods's bones and soft tissue are healed, rehabilitation will likely entail gentle range-of-motion exercises to stimulate neuromuscular activity before slowly ramping up the intensity, says Boothby. That will give Woods a better idea of what his physical limitations are. Setbacks, he warns, are to be expected."}

Both candidates spent the weekend criss-crossing the state to get out the vote, with McAuliffe on Saturday traveling \"more than 120 miles\" to \"eight stops in six cities\" during an 11-hour period, the Times reports, noting while McAuliffe \"hustled through sparsely attended events from morning to night,\" Youngkin \"greeted crowds of more than 1,000.\"\n\nAccording to Axios, much of the focus should be on Loudoun County, a place some 40 miles outside of D.C. that's seen as \"ground zero\" for the GOP culture war issues that have bolstered Youngkin's prospects. With its fast-growing population, the county is also \"a diversifying area key to Democratic success\" in the rest of the state. Loudoun, the wealthiest county in the U.S., is reportedly expected to go to McAuliffe even if Youngkin wins overall, \"but insiders are watching how much [Youngkin] can reverse the big gains Dems have made in the county in the past three major elections,\" Axios reports.

The rehearsals are meant to increase safety and to make the gunfire scenes more realistic, he added.\n\n\"In America, you have these professionals who are in charge of the props and the stunt coordinators, and few know anything about real firearms,\" he said, which is why \"in Hollywood movies, so many characters shoot without aiming.\"\n\nAlthough the accident is still under investigation, Nesher said he thought it was likely that a live round of ammunition had been placed in the gun and that basic precautions were not taken.\n\nOphir Award-winning cinematographer Tobias Hochstein posted a tribute to Halyna Hutchins, the victim of the shooting, on his Facebook page: \"Sad and tragic. I'm thinking about her kid and family and friends. No excuse for live fire on a set in 2021.

The speed limit is 45 mph.\n\nA KABC-TV helicopter showed the car on its side, with its front end heavily damaged just off the side of a road near a hillside, with its airbags deployed. The 45-year-old Woods was taken to the hospital by ambulance, authorities said.\n\n\"Tiger Woods was in a single-car accident this morning in California where he suffered multiple leg injuries,\" said his manager, Mark Steinberg. \"He is currently in surgery and we thank you for your privacy and support.\"\n\nThe crash happened on the border of Rolling Hills Estates and Rancho Palos Verdes, two upscale communities about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThere was a second crash when a vehicle that had apparently stopped to help Woods got hit, said Christopher Thomas, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. That wreck was very minor, and no one was hurt.\n\nWoods was in Los Angeles over the weekend as the tournament host of the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club, where he presented the trophy on Sunday. He was to spend Monday and Tuesday filming with Discovery-owned GOLFTV, with whom he has an endorsement. A tweet Monday showed Woods in a cart smiling with comedian David Spade.\n\nAccording to Golf Digest, also owned by Discovery, the TV shoot was on-course lessons for celebrities, such as Spade and Dwyane Wade, at Rolling Hills Country Club.\n\nWoods, a 15-time major champion who shares with Sam Snead the PGA Tour record of 82 career victories, has been recovering from Dec. 23 surgery on his lower back. It was his fifth back surgery and first since his lower spine was fused in April 2017, allowing him to stage a remarkable comeback that culminated with his fifth Masters title in 2019.\n\nHe has carried the sport since his record-setting Masters victory in 1997 when he was 21, winning at the most prolific rate in modern PGA Tour history. He is singularly responsible for TV ratings spiking, which has led to enormous increases in prize money during his career. Even at 45, he remains the biggest draw in the sport.\n\nThe SUV he was driving Tuesday had tournament logos on the side door, indicating it was a courtesy car for players at the Genesis Invitational. Tournament director Mike Antolini did not immediately respond to a text message, though it is not unusual for players to keep courtesy cars a few days after the event.\n\nWoods feared he would never play again until the 2017 fusion surgery. He returned to win the Tour Championship to close out the 2018 season and won the Masters in April 2019 for the fifth time.\n\nHe last played Dec. 20 in the PNC Championship in Orlando, Florida, an unofficial event where players are paired with parents or children. He played with his son, Charlie, who is now 12. Woods also has a 13-year-old daughter."}

Joe Montana and Steve Young combined to win five Super Bowls and won four MVPs between them.\n\nMontana and legendary receiver Jerry Rice dominated the NFL during Montana's tenure as the starter. The pair connected for 386 receptions, 6,710 yards and 67 touchdowns in 77 games.\n\nMontana was widely regarded as the best quarterback in NFL history until Tom Brady came along and won six Super Bowls over the past 20 years. The 43-year-old Brady — who is playing his first season with the Buccaneers — helped Tampa get to this weekend's NFC Championship game against the Green Bay Packers. This will be the 14th time Brady is the quarterback on one of the final four teams.\n\nRice joined 95.7 The Game's The Morning Roast and was asked about who he would want as his quarterback with the game on the line between Montana and Brady (h/t 49ers Web Zone):\n\n\"I'm going to go with Joe Montana because, like I said, it was a different era. Not taking anything away from what's happening today, but you look at the game today, the way it's played, you look at how receivers are protected — I never thought I would see an era where the running back doesn't have to be on the ground for them to stop the play because this, to me, is supposed to be tackle football. So, it's a whole different era, and I would go with Montana any day because he was Joe Cool, and he was in an era where he was not as protected.\"\n\nIt's no surprise to see that Rice chooses Montana. He's always been loyal to the 49ers. Rice is also correct when bringing up the differences in how the game is played. It's a long video, but check out some of the hits players took in the 1980s (some of the footage looks like it was shot with a 1980s Fisher Price kids camera):\n\nIn today's NFL, you might get a 15-yard penalty for sneezing near the quarterback. Brady has only suffered one significant injury in his career when he tore his ACL and MCL in Week 1 of the 2008 season. Bernard Pollard's hit on Brady resulted in the NFL changing its rules to protect quarterbacks.\n\nMontana played during an era where a player could get steamrolled by a defender without any consequences, so no one was letting up when they were attacking the QB.\n\nMontana only started all 16 games twice during his 16-year career, while Brady suited up for every game 17 times in 21 seasons. He missed four starts because of suspension in 2016.\n\nBoth quarterbacks have a ton of playoff success on their resumes.\n\nHere is how Montana and Brady's postseason stats look (per Pro Football Reference):\n\nMontana: 16-7 record (.695 win%), 62.7 completion percentage, 251 yards per game, 7.0 adjusted net yards per attempt, 45 touchdowns, 21 interceptions, 4-0 record in the Super Bowl, three Super Bowl MVPs."}

Of course it's not strictly accurate, but ... it gives you a rough idea about what that lifestyle, what the pressures of putting duty and service above family and everything else, what can come from that.\"\n\nHarry and Meghan have been mired in a long-running war of words and lawsuits with a large portion of the tabloid media, fighting multiple legal cases against publications and photo agencies that had printed details of their private lives.\n\nEarlier this month, Meghan won a privacy claim against the publishers of the Mail on Sunday after they published a letter she sent her father, and launched a stinging rebuke to \"dehumanizing\" media organizations after the verdict, saying the \"damage they have done and continue to do runs deep.\"\n\nHarry: We've Zoomed the Queen a few times\n\nHarry told Corden his life with Meghan in LA will be \"a slightly different version, but a continuation, of what we were doing back in the UK anyway.\""}

With no power, her apartment was dangerously cold and the family pulled on several pairs of pants and sweaters to keep warm.\n\nBenitez's power and water returned Thursday, just as her fridge and cupboards grew bare. But now a new struggle begins: The storm kept her from cleaning homes all week and, as her family's sole wage earner, she's instantly behind on rent and utilities. Grocery donations from friends have helped. But those will run out soon.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who are still struggling,\" Benitez, 51, said. \"There are a lot of people who don't have enough to eat, who don't have enough blankets. This is not over.\"\n\nAs millions of Texans grapple with the aftermath of a deadly winter storm, people of color and low-income communities who were disproportionately affected by blackouts and burst pipes could now face the hardest journey to recovery, experts said.\n\nThe historic winter weather exacerbated pre-existing disparities like poor infrastructure and lack of resources in marginalized communities. Black and Latino communities who were disproportionately hit by COVID-19 now must struggle to recover from one of the worst weather events to ever hit Texas. And previous disaster response failures indicate the situation may get worse as the state thaws out.\n\n\"What you will see, as with COVID-19 and with any disaster, is disproportionate death and negative impacts for those who are most vulnerable among us,\" said Chauncia Willis, chief executive of the Institute for Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency Management, an Atlanta-based non-profit focused on emergency management and racial justice. \"These inequities are easily identifiable before disaster and, of course, they're rooted in systemic bias, racism and the country's anti-poverty mindset.\"\n\nLower-income families may not be able to stock up on essentials ahead of the storm, have access to transportation in the event of an emergency or afford precautions like renters or flood insurance, leaving them vulnerable when disaster strikes, Willis said.\n\nPower outages numbered about 139,000 in Texas by Friday, down from a high of 4 million earlier in the week. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has deployed generators, blankets and pallets of bottled water to Texans. Meanwhile, advocacy groups have been sheltering those in need and delivering meals and groceries to families who still can't find food, as grocery stores struggle to restock.\n\nThe Austin Justice Coalition delivered food to more than 40 families around Austin who had run out of food, said João Paulo Connolly, the group's director of housing and community development. Around 90% of those families were Black or Latino, he said.\n\nThe storm hit families of all races and ethnicities and knocked out power even in affluent neighborhoods, Connolly said. But families of color in lower-income areas often don't have a car or the funds to hunt for groceries or make quick repairs on busted pipes, he said. Thus, it'll take them longer to recover from the disaster, he said.\n\n\"Everyone's out of food and having a hard time getting to the store,\" Connolly said. \"It's just a general mess.\"\n\nIn Houston, the frigid temperatures and outages created a citywide water crisis. As power gets restored and drinkable water returns to homes, county officials are studying how best to help residents and use federal funds to restore neighborhoods.\n\nCounty Commissioner Rodney Ellis, whose district is 70% Black and Hispanic, said he hopes communities of color get equitable disaster relief. During the disaster response following 2017's Hurricane Harvey, which flooded most of Houston, more affluent communities often benefited more from federal disaster funds than communities of color -- something he'd like to reverse following this event, he said.\n\n\"Often time in government, we don't do things with that equity lens,\" he said. \"I'm worried about communities of color being disproportionately impacted.\"\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas directed utility companies to implement outages to compensate for the increased demand in electricity and disrupted supply, according to Varun Rai, director of the University of Texas-Austin's Energy Institute.\n\nUtility companies prioritized keeping the power on in downtown areas that include critical service providers such as hospitals and nursing homes, which benefited residents in the typically densely populated, wealthier neighborhoods nearby, he said.\n\nLower-income families typically live farther from these areas, meaning they were less likely to have power during planned outages, Rai said.\n\n\"Even when you're not in emergency situations, like we are today, it takes much longer and it's much harder for many communities to get access,\" he said.\n\nThis stark contrast was highlighted in photos taken in Austin that show the downtown area glaringly bright while hundreds of thousands of homes, particularly in East Austin, the city's historically Black and Hispanic neighborhood, were without power.\n\nThe increased demand for electricity will likely mean electric bills will go up, Rai said, another blow to lower-income households that already spend a higher percentage of their income on utilities.\n\nAlthough electricity is back on for many Texans, the crisis is not over due to the lack of safe drinking water in many areas. Seven million Texans must boil their tap water before drinking it because record low temperatures damaged infrastructure and pipes."}

And if I were among the residents Republicans are targeting, which I'm comfortably not, I'd find it insulting that my elected officials think speaking to the tribal instinct in me is a sufficient enough campaign strategy to secure re-election.\n\nIt's why a predator like Brock Turner, the Stanford University athlete who was convicted of sexually assaulting a young woman behind a dumpster, can garner empathy from the trial judge in his case. \"A prison sentence would have a severe impact on him,\" said Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky, adding that he didn't believe Turner would be \"a danger to others\" — even though he already had been.\n\nIt's why an 18-year-old white male like Rittenhouse can drive from one city to another, be armed for a fight, kill two people, injure another, and be treated like a prodigal son who made an honest mistake in an act of mere self-defense. Over the course of the trial, as the court disallowed words of empathy for the shooting victims and offered space for a tearful killer to plead his case, I've been reminded of how willing our nation is to offer the benefit of the doubt to some while clanking a prison-cell door and throwing away the key for others. Rittenhouse was acquitted on all charges by a 12-person jury on Nov. 19.\n\nAcross the board, active biases like these are easy to spot but hard to tackle. According to Iliana Pujols, policy director with the Connecticut Justice Alliance (CTJA), that's partly because battles over ideological rhetoric are hard to win.\n\n\"It's a really hard fight because we're up against racist ideas,\" she said. \"Not just actions.\"\n\n\"I think this is a perfect time to compare the issues we're seeing in Connecticut to Kenosha,\" Pujols said, \"because it's an empathy issue. The Republican Party doesn't know where these kids are coming from. They can't relate to them.\"\n\nAfter hosting a number of focus groups they call \"vision sessions\" in West Hartford to shine a light on issues impacting urban youth, Pujols said it's clear that those with privilege or in power are making decisions based on a lack of information and predisposed beliefs about youth from places like Waterbury, Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport.\n\n\"Everyone's eager to invest in crime prevention now, but that's only because the problem, small as it may be, is coming into their neighborhoods,\" she said.\n\nThat thin border between the inner city and the suburb is often highly policed to ensure there isn't crime creeping into places where it \"doesn't belong.\" Policies to beat city crimes back into the downtown area or low-income neighborhoods are all erected in the spirit of security theater, suggesting that as long as the families with the largest lawns feel safe, that's a job well done."}

Brady entered the game needing just 68 yards to surpass former New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who has since retired and is now working for NBC.\n\n\"Guys did a great job catching for me the last 22 years, all of 'em which I hope ... felt a little piece of happiness tonight, watching that, because everybody contributed,\" Brady told NBC Sunday Night Football reporter Michelle Tafoya. \"I sure as hell can't catch anything, everyone's seen that drop against the Eagles in the Super Bowl.\"\n\nBrady is jokingly referring to the Patriots' trick play during the second quarter of the Super Bowl, where he flanked out as a receiver but dropped a wide-open pass during a trick play. Pouring salt into Brady's wound was Eagles quarterback Nick Foles, who hauled in a touchdown pass later in the game during the famed \"Philly Special\" play.\n\nIt's not the first time Brady has recalled the loss to the Eagles. During the Facebook documentary series Tom vs. Time, Brady revealed the most difficult part of losing that Super Bowl was watching his kids cry, and opened up about the late fumble caused by Brandon Graham that essentially sealed the Eagles victory.\n\n\"I thought we were going to go down and score. I thought we were going to win the game,\" Brady said. \"I thought about that play 500 times in five days.\"\n\nGotham Chopra, director of the Tom vs. Time documentary series, thought Brady and the Patriots were going to win, revealing in a Facebook post following the game that the loss to the Eagles forced the production team to rethink the series' final episode.\n\n\"The truth is we had a plan, but unconsciously, it was tied to the Pats winning the Super Bowl and, when that didn't happen (congrats, Eagles!), I felt like we needed to pause and recalibrate,\" Chopra wrote.\n\nBrady also opened up about the loss ahead of the 2019 rematch against the Eagles during an interview on SportsRadio 93.7 WEEI in Boston.\n\n\"You assume I'm over it? Come on now,\" Brady said. \"That's a lot of mental scar tissue from that year. That was a tough game...They deserved it that year.\"\n\nBrady will face the Eagles for the first time since joining the Buccaneers on Thursday Night Football on Oct. 14, but the situation will obviously be a lot different.

The broadcast averaged a 34 share, meaning 34% of all households with televisions were tuned into the game, a new record for Sunday Night Football.\n\nThe exact ratings will be released Tuesday morning.\n\nWhile impressive, especially considering the decline of cable subscribers over the past few years, the game didn't come close to breaking into the top five regular-season broadcasts of all time (four of which were Thanksgiving games featuring the Dallas Cowboys):\n\nNetwork Window Game Date Time Viewers Network ABC Window MNF Game Giants-49ers Date 12/3/90 Time 9 p.m. Viewers 41.5 million Network NBC Window Thanksgiving Game Dolphins-Cowboys Date 11/25/90 Time 4 p.m Viewers 38.4 million Network NBC Window Thanksgiving Game Chiefs-Cowboys Date 11/23/95 Time 4 p.m Viewers 35.7 million Network FOX Window Thanksgiving Game Washington-Cowboys Date 11/24/16 Time 4:36 p.m. Viewers 35.1 million Network CBS Window Thanksgiving Game Vikings-Cowboys Date 11/26/87 Time 4 p.m. Viewers 34 million"}

Andrew Cuomo, as the politician faced sexual harassment allegations earlier this year.\n\nThe network had suspended its prime-time host on Tuesday to investigate his conduct, after New York's attorney general released details showing he was more involved than previously known in helping to strategize and reach out to other journalists as his brother fought to keep his job.\n\nCNN hired a law firm for that review, which it would not identify. The lawyers recommended Chris Cuomo's termination and CNN chief Jeff Zucker informed the anchor of the decision on Saturday.\n\n\"It goes without saying that these decisions are not easy, and there are a lot of complex factors involved,\" Zucker said in an email to CNN staff on Saturday.\n\nThe network said that \"while in the process of that review, additional information has come to light.\" CNN would not discuss that information, or characterize whether it had anything to do with his brother.\n\nCuomo issued a statement on Twitter calling the decision disappointing.\n\n\"This is not how I want my time at CNN to end but I have already told you why and how I helped my brother. So let me now say as disappointing as this is, I could not be more proud of the team at Cuomo Prime Time and the work we did,\" he said.\n\nEven with the firing, CNN said it will continue to investigate Cuomo's conduct \"as appropriate.\"\n\nA year ago the two sons of the late New York Gov.

Her office found Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed at least 11 women; the former governor resigned in August to avoid a likely impeachment trial.\n\nChris Cuomo and CNN have been under fire for months about their anchor's conduct. When it first came to light in May that the anchor had been talking to his brother's advisers, the network acknowledged that he had broken its rules but, as CNN said in a statement upon his suspension earlier this week, \"we also appreciated the unique position he was in and understood his need to put family first and job second.\"\n\nThe transcripts released by James this week revealed considerably more detail about Cuomo's involvement — conduct CNN executives admitted was a surprise even to them."}

We've seen Khamenei's call for the elimination of Israel, which is incitement. So if Twitter has a policy against incitement of violence, it needs to be applied uniformly.\"\n\nA Twitter spokesperson responded to the accusations of double standards in enforcing incitement prohibitions by telling VOA Persian that the platform has taken enforcement action against world leaders prior to Friday.\n\nThe spokesperson said Twitter focused its Friday actions on what he called the \"harm presented by [Trump's personal] account specifically,\" and shared a link to Twitter's statement explaining why it believes Trump's last tweets have the potential to incite further violence following Wednesday's storming of the U.S. Capitol complex by some of his supporters.\n\nAsked what Twitter is doing to demonstrate that it is treating world leaders consistently, the spokesperson said the company's policy of displaying a \"government account\" label for users affiliated with the five permanent member states of the U.N. Security Council will soon be expanded to include similar labeling for the officials of other nations. No further details were provided.\n\nTwitter's action against the Khamenei account came hours before its banning of Trump.\n\nThe Khamenei account had posted a Friday tweet in which the Iranian supreme leader called coronavirus vaccines produced by the U.S., Britain and France \"completely untrustworthy\" and accused the Western powers of trying to \"contaminate\" other nations by offering to send them the vaccines.\n\nThe Khamenei tweet prompted Iranian activists such as VOA Persian TV show host Masih Alinejad to urge Twitter to suspend his account for spreading misinformation about the vaccines.

Today, 2 in 3 eligible individuals – 189 million Americans – are fully vaccinated. That's an increase from approximately 2 million reported when the President took office. The potential authorization of the first COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5-11, which is currently under consideration by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), would be another major milestone in our efforts to build on this historic progress and protect even more Americans.\n\nIn anticipation of the FDA's independent advisory committee meeting on October 26 and the CDC's independent advisory committee meeting on November 2-3, today the Biden Administration is announcing a plan to ensure that, if a vaccine is authorized for children ages 5-11, it is quickly distributed and made conveniently and equitably available to families across the country. The start of a vaccination program for children ages 5-11 will depend on the independent FDA and CDC process and timeline, but our planning efforts mean that we will be ready to begin getting shots in arms in the days following a final CDC recommendation. These steps will be critical in ensuring that we are staying ahead of the virus by keeping kids and families safe, especially those at highest risk.\n\nMillions of adolescents ages 12-17 have been safely vaccinated, and we know vaccines work. Fully vaccinated individuals are 10 times less likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 and have a high degree of protection, including against the Delta variant. The consequences of a pediatric COVID-19 case can be serious and potentially last months.\n\nAs with vaccination for those 12 and older, the success of this program will rely heavily on states, Tribes, and territories to help implement a smooth rollout. A major component of the Administration's operational planning is working closely with state and local leaders to ensure they are prepared to distribute and administer vaccines. The Administration is hosting operational readiness calls with every jurisdiction, encouraging them to help increase enrollment of pediatric providers, and will be providing resources to support them as critical partners in the outreach and public education campaign. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, states will continue to receive unprecedented levels of federal support, including full reimbursement from the federal government for vaccination operations and outreach programs."}

But I wish missing women of color got this much attention\n\nThe apparent murder of 22-year-old Gabby Petito has been a consistent part of the American news cycle since she disappeared on 11 September. Her YouTube presence and participation in the Instagram #vanlife subculture, which involves young people travelling around the country living aesthetically appealing lives in vans and converted buses, provided plenty of content for internet detectives on sites like TikTok and Reddit to consume. Her story is heart-wrenching, especially after police footage has emerged of Petito and her fiance, Brian Laundrie, who is now a \"person of interest\" in her death, having a domestic crisis.\n\nBut the story also feels eerily familiar – so familiar, in fact, that there is a term for it: \"missing white woman syndrome\". White women, particularly conventionally attractive middle- or upper-class white women, tend to receive disproportionate media coverage when they go missing. Petito's case is tragic, but the media attention it has attracted replicates a systemic pattern.\n\nGabby Petito deserves justice; there is no doubt about that. Her death was ruled a homicide by a Wyoming coroner on 21 September, a few days after her body was discovered. She'd been missing for weeks after a roadtrip with her fiance, who returned from the trip without her and soon went missing himself. Her story quickly went viral on social media outlets: a Reddit forum created to track her case has accumulated more than 119,000 members at time of writing, and TikTok videos featuring her have received over 200m views.\n\nIt is concerning when policy priorities are so clearly weighted toward victims of certain racial identities and social classes\n\nThe media joined in this explosion of attention, and public officials soon followed. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, declared online that he has directed all state agencies to assist with the search for Laundrie, who is on the run. I hope they catch him. According to 2019 numbers, however, there are well over a thousand other missing persons in Florida alone. Media attention influences how politicians and law enforcement agencies allocate resources, and it is concerning when policy priorities are so clearly weighted toward victims of certain racial identities and social classes."}

Super Bowl LV Doesn't Leave Broncos Fans With Good Options\n\nBroncos fans, there is no God.\n\nSorry to break the news, folks.\n\nWhat's my proof, you ask? Well for starters, God would never inflict torture on his people.\n\nThe kind of torture Broncos fans will have to endure during Sunday's Super Bowl.\n\nI'm being dramatic, you say? Well, let's examine the evidence:\n\nOn one side, you have the Kansas City Chiefs. As in the same Chiefs who are among the Broncos' archrivals in the AFC West. Denver and KC have had some knock-down, drag-out wars over the last several decades and there is no love lost between the two teams.\n\nOn the other sideline, we have the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, whom Broncos fans might not have had an issue with had TOM BRADY not signed with the team last year.\n\nYes, that Tom Brady. As in, the Broncos longtime nemesis who is ridiculously too handsome, married to a supermodel and has more Super Bowl rings than I have teeth!\n\nIt's evil versus evil. Both teams may as well make the \"Star Wars Imperial March\" their entrance music when they take the field.\n\nAnd Broncos fans can't do nothin' about it, either. We just gotta sit there helplessly while two of our fiercest enemies go at it in the biggest game of the year.\n\nSee. There is no God.\n\nI recently posted a poll on Twitter this week asking Broncos fans if they'd be rooting for the Chiefs or Tom Brady in the big game. About a third of respondents said they refuse to root for either team!\n\nMy sister Julie Thuis, a die hard Broncos fan, is in that category.\n\n\"I mean, do I really want to hear, 'Tom Brady has now won Super Bowls in the AFC and NFC and look at this, he's the greatest of all time and blah blah blah blah?'\" my sister said, who added a couple of choice words for Brady that you can't say on the radio ... or in print.\n\n\"But I also don't want Kansas City to go back-to-back. So pretty much I'm screwed,\" she said.\n\nYep, if Kansas City wins Sunday they'll have won two Super Bowls in a row, something that's only happened twice since 1998 and 1999, when the Broncos went back-to-back, and again in 2004 and 2005, with the Patriots ... who were led by ... yeah, you know who I'm talking about.\n\nWhile many Broncos fans say they're conflicted over their rooting interest Sunday, Christine Voss of Denver isn't one of them.\n\nVoss is a Colorado native. She's such a huge Broncos fan that she has the coordinates of the 50-yard line at the Broncos stadium tattooed on her wrist. She'll be rooting for Tampa Bay.\n\n\"I mean, it's not a choice,\" Voss said. \"A divisional rival is not any team I'm ever going to cheer for. It's anyone but the Chiefs and anybody but the Raiders — who would never be there. But there's no choice in my mind.\"\n\nUp until last year, the Broncos were able to say they were the only AFC West team to win a Super Bowl since the 1983 Raiders. But now the Chiefs, led by 25-year-old quarterback sensation Patrick Mahomes, threaten to blow past Denver's success during all those years the Broncos dominated the division.\n\nBesides, Voss says, Broncos fans really don't have an axe to grind with Tom Brady anyway.\n\n\"He does not have a winning record against the Broncos,\" she said. \"In the playoffs, he especially has not been able to challenge them. I mean, we hated Tom Brady because he was so good and we hated the Patriots. But that's not a rivalry.\"\n\nThat's a really good point. In fact, mostly recently, when the Broncos last won the Super Bowl five years ago, they beat Tom Brady and his former team, the Patriots, to get there.\n\nSo, Broncos fans, why all the Brady-hating?\n\nWell, Dave DeNovellis of Denver has a lot to say about that.\n\n\"He's basically the Voldemort of the NFL,\" DeNovellis said, comparing Tom Brady to the \"Harry Potter\" villain with the maniacal laugh.\n\nDeNovellis said that ain't even the worst part about Brady.\n\n\"He trademarked the term 'Tom-pa Bay.' As in T-O-M-P-A Bay,\" he said. \"That's just ridiculous.\"\n\nYes, when Tom Brady joined the Buccaneers this season, he in fact applied to trademark the phrases \"Tompa Bay\" and \"Tampa Brady\" with the U.S Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nI'm not kidding.\n\nThat's something perhaps even Voldemort wouldn't do.\n\nFormer State Rep. Cole Wist grew up on the Western Slope rooting for the Broncos to stomp teams like Kansas City. But now, he's begrudgingly backing the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. When he replied to my Twitter poll he used the hashtag, #NeverBrady.\n\n\"On the one hand, I appreciate that the guy is 43-years-old and is playing at this level,\" Wist said. \"On the other hand it irritates the crap out of me.\"\n\nBut seriously, Broncos fans are having a really hard time picking sides. Twitter user LibPatriot said, \"I'm rooting for the commercials.\" SM Lindberg wrote, \"My husband is rooting for a cancellation. I entered the Volvo sweepstakes, so I'm rooting for a safety.\"\n\nA friend of mine who reports for the Albuquerque Journal, Kyle Land, said, \"I literally can't bring myself to root for either (team). Just wishing baseball season would start already.\"\n\nThat's a real sore subject for Rockies fans right now, though. So let's not even go there.\n\nBut some of you had a good idea! When in doubt, maybe root for the team with the most Colorado connections. For Kansas City, there's offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy, who played college football for the Colorado Buffaloes. The Chiefs also have Mike Pennel, who went to CSU-Pueblo.\n\nBut Ryan Jensen, who also played football at CSU-Pueblo, plays for Tampa Bay. As does CSU's Shaq Barrett. So that might be a wash.\n\nOr, you can just root for the underdog, like Christine Voss is doing.\n\n\"You know, this football season was so exciting,\" Voss said. \"It was exciting seeing the Bills and Browns get as far as they did. So I'm all for the underdog story. So, remove Tom Brady from the equation. Like, sure I don't wanna see his face. Like, no one does. But take him out of the equation, they're the clear choice.\"\n\nBut is there really a \"clear choice\" in this matchup of the Two Evils?\n\nMay God help us. If he even exists."}

She counts herself as lucky that she received about $17,000 from FEMA — much more than most of her Queens neighbors.\n\nBhagwandin, 51, had several contractors come out to assess the damage, and none wanted to touch the severely compromised foundation. Instead, they advised her to fill the basement and lift the house, a project that would cost an estimated $300,000.\n\nAnd that's on top of what she's already spent on repairs after repeated floods. She keeps a trove of manilla folders filled with photos of damage.\n\n\"I don't understand what kind of life this is in New York City,\" Bhagwandin said. \"Do you know how scary it is? I run out of the house every time it rains. I cannot take a summer vacation because I have to stay and watch my house.\"\n\nBhagwandin is one of many New Yorkers whose homes were damaged in the deadly Sept. 1 storm and who say they are still waiting for adequate assistance, more than three months later.\n\nRenters and homeowners are facing different obstacles — and seek different types of relief. Bhagwandin wants the city to buy her home. Tenants, meanwhile, need their apartments renovated or a whole new place to live.\n\nYet storm victims on all sides say their ongoing shared experiences, including temporary displacement and long-term uncertainty, underscore a housing crisis exacerbated by climate change.\n\nAnd despite recently extended state and federal timelines to apply for financial assistance, storm-slammed New Yorkers charge they've been largely forsaken.\n\n\"This is what's very painful here, that we have to be chasing all these politicians to get this work done,\" Bhagwandin said. \"There's no urgency.\"\n\n'We Live Day to Day'\n\nFor renters, securing new housing in New York's expensive market has been particularly difficult — especially in the wake of the storm, which killed 13 people, 11 of whom died in basement apartments.\n\nHeidi Pashko and her husband have been living with their adult son and his two young children on Long Island ever since Ida hit. Their rented Forest Hills one-bedroom apartment — their home for more than 40 years — is still a wreck.\n\nPashko, 67, was used to paying \"fabulous rent\" for her spacious first-floor unit with high ceilings, but her hunt for furnished studios and one-bedrooms in Queens and Long Island has been discouraging. Nothing is as good as what she'd had — and everything costs at least double what she'd been paying.\n\n\"I feel bad sleeping on their couch, but I have nowhere to go,\" Pashko said. \"As long as my son will have me, I'm staying here. I'm with the grandkids every day, taking care of them.\"\n\nPashko's retirement from her job as a public school aide began the day of the storm, so money is tight. Before Ida, she'd just renovated the apartment and purchased a new stove and refrigerator.\n\n\"It's hard,\" she added. \"I don't know what my plans are. I don't know what I'm doing. We live from day to day.\"\n\nPashko said she and her husband received \"a couple thousand dollars\" from FEMA and are in the process of appealing to get more.\n\n'Emotionally, You're Done'\n\nAs of Dec. 3, more than 88,700 people in New York City had applied for assistance from FEMA, with $163.7 million approved, according to Kevin Sur, an agency spokesperson. Sur declined to specify how many applicants were approved or denied funds.\n\nData FEMA provided to Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-Queens, The Bronx) and Jamaal Bowman (D-The Bronx, Westchester) showed that about half of applicants in Queens and the Bronx received funding.\n\nThe two politicians sent a letter to FEMA late last month asking the agency to provide sufficient funds to help storm-battered New Yorkers \"rebuild their homes and restore damaged property.\"\n\nApplicants can appeal FEMA's decision within 60 days.\n\nThat's what Tina Jimenez, 62 of East Elmhurst is doing. But it's not easy.\n\n\"Emotionally, you're done,\" Jimenez said. \"This added burden — you have to explain yourself and explain yourself and everybody's giving you a different answer.\""}

Though most of the charges brought so far have been misdemeanors, acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin said Tuesday the Justice Department was considering bringing sedition charges against some of the rioters, effectively accusing them of attempting to overthrow or defeat the government.\n\n\"This is only the beginning,\" Sherwin said. \"We're going to focus on the most significant charges as a deterrent because, regardless of it was just a trespass in the Capitol or if someone planted a pipe bomb, you will be charged and you will be found.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has created a specialized strike force to examine the possibility of sedition charges, which could carry up to 20 years in prison. Officials said they were utilizing some of the same techniques in the riot probe as they use in international counterterrorism investigations, examining the money flow and movement of defendants leading up to the breach. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called for the rioters to be added to a no-fly list, a tool most commonly associated with terrorisms investigations.\n\nThe statements by FBI and Justice Department officials on Tuesday were intended as both a defense of federal law enforcement preparations before the deadly riot and as a warning to participants. But they also raised new questions about the coordination across agencies for the Jan. 6 riot, which was sparked by Trump's calls for his supporters to fight Congress' vote confirming President-elect Joe Biden's victory.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the riot, some law enforcement officials, including the Capitol police chief, said they were unaware of serious concerns leading up to Jan. 6 and had prepared only for a free-speech protest.\n\nBut on Tuesday, The Washington Post reported on the existence of a Jan. 5 report from the FBI's field office in Norfolk, Virginia, that forecast, in detail, the chances that extremists could commit \"war\" in Washington the following day. Steven D'Antuono, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington field office, said that once he received the Jan. 5 warning, the information was quickly shared with other law enforcement agencies through the joint terrorism task force.\n\nD'Antuono was among the officials who suggested law enforcement had simply been caught off guard, saying on Friday: \"There was no indication that there was anything other than First Amendment protected activity.\"\n\nHe did not explain the discrepancy in his statements, though he suggested Tuesday that the Norfolk warning was based on nonspecific information in terms of individual leads to investigate, characterizing it as a \"thread on a message board\" that was not attributable to any specific person.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday night, the FBI said the report's author had warned that the \"FBI might be encroaching on free speech rights\" in pursuing further action, and that the document itself did not necessarily associate the comments with a national security threat or crime. It highlighted D'Antuono's remarks at the news conference suggesting that without knowing the identity of the people whose words were cited in the report, there was not much that could be done with the information.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police and other official didn't immediately respond to questions about their own initial assessments of the threat.\n\nA U.S. defense official familiar with the discussions said Tuesday that Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy was not notified about the FBI warning.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that it is unclear whether any defense or military officials heard about the notification from the FBI, but that statements in recent days from all the leaders indicate they weren't aware that violence of that level was expected at the Capitol."}

The agreements include supply of the initial two doses of their vaccines as well as billions of dollars in potential boosters for wealthy nations.\n\nGoing forward, analysts have forecast revenue of over $6.6 billion for the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and $7.6 billion for Moderna in 2023, mostly from booster sales. They eventually see the annual market settling at around $5 billion or higher, with additional drugmakers competing for those sales.\n\nThe vaccine makers say that evidence of waning antibody levels in vaccinated people after six months, as well as an increasing rate of breakthrough infections in countries hit by the Delta variant, support the need for booster shots.\n\nSome early data suggests that the Moderna vaccine, which delivers a higher dose at the outset, may be more durable than Pfizer's shot, but more research is needed to determine whether that is influenced by the age or underlying health of the people vaccinated.\n\nAs a result, it is far from clear how many people will need boosters, and how often. The profit potential of booster shots may be limited by the number of competitors who enter the market. In addition, some scientists question whether there is enough evidence that boosters are needed, particularly for younger, healthy people. The World Health Organization has asked governments to hold off on booster shots until more people worldwide receive their initial doses.\n\n\"We don't know what the market forces will be,\" Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in an interview last week. \"At some point, this will become a more traditional market - we'll look at what are the populations at risk, what value are we creating, and what are the number of products that serve that value.

The group provided no evidence to support the claim but US officials have said it was likely behind the atrocity.\n\nIt was ISIS-K's most globally consequential action to date and drew a promise of retribution from US President Joe Biden.\n\nBut the group, known in full as ISIS-Khorasan, has been responsible for thousands of deaths since its 2015 formation.\n\nIts members operate in central Asia, and the group's name comes from its terminology for the area that includes Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nIn 2018 it was ranked the world's fourth deadliest terror group, claiming more than 1,000 lives, mostly in Afghanistan, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace, which monitors global terrorism annually.\n\nSince then the group's growth has been limited and its militants have fought the Taliban. But they have capitalized on uncertainty in Afghanistan in recent months to launch brutal attacks, and the impending withdrawal of troops by the United States threatens to give them a window in which to regain strength.\n\nHow was ISIS-K formed?\n\nThe group is a branch of ISIS, the terror group that first emerged in Syria and Iraq and, at its peak, controlled a huge stretch of territory stretching from western Syria to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. The original group had its self-declared caliphate ended by US-backed forces in recent years.\n\nBut the connection between ISIS-K and its apparent parent group is not entirely clear; the affiliates share an ideology and tactics, but the depth of their relationship with regards to organization and command and control has never been entirely established.\n\nUS intelligence officials previously told CNN that the ISIS-K membership includes \"a small number of veteran jihadists from Syria and other foreign terrorist fighters,\" saying that the US had identified 10 to 15 of their top operatives in Afghanistan.\n\nIts earliest members included Pakistani militants who emerged in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province around a decade ago, many of whom had fled Pakistan and defected from other terror groups, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nCounter-terrorism analysts estimate its strength now at around 1,500-2,000, but that number may soon grow. Some captured ISIS-K fighters were being held in prisons near Kabul, which the Taliban overran as their offensive accelerated.\n\nWhat do they want?\n\nKey figures involved in the formation of ISIS-K included Taliban defectors – such as former Taliban member Abdul Rauf Aliza, who was briefly held at Guantanamo Bay and was killed in a US drone strike in 2015 after joining ISIS.\n\nBut the group has a mutual hatred of the Taliban, and attracts those with views even more radical than the Taliban.\n\nUnlike the militant group that has seized power in Afghanistan, ISIS and its affiliates have little interest in political governance.\n\n\"ISIS believes that only God can rule. And even though the Taliban is attempting to establish an Islamic emirate, that's not enough for ISIS,\" Colin Clarke, author of \"After the Caliphate: The Islamic State and the Future of the Terrorist Diaspora,\" told CNN before the Kabul airport attacks took place.\n\nIn any place they control, Clarke said, ISIS-K \"are going to implement extremely harsh Sharia law. And they're going to rule with an iron fist. They want to attract and recruit the most ardent sociopaths in the country and wanton violence helps them bring other fighters into the organization that have a similar mindset.\"\n\nISIS-K have intentions that stretch beyond the borders of Afghanistan and Pakistan; they intend to \"establish a Caliphate beginning in South and Central Asia, governed by sharia law, which will expand as Muslims from across the region and world join,\" according to CSIS."}

Rallying outside the White House, he unleashed a mob of supporters to \"fight like hell\" for him at the Capitol just as Congress was certifying Democrat Joe Biden's victory. As hundreds stormed the building, some in tactical gear engaging in bloody combat with police, lawmakers fled for their lives. Five people died.\n\nThe verdict, on a vote of 57-43, is all but certain to influence not only the former president's political future but that of the senators sworn to deliver impartial justice as jurors. Seven Republicans joined all Democrats to convict, but it was far from the two-third threshold required.\n\nThe outcome after the uprising leaves unresolved the nation's wrenching divisions over Trump's brand of politics that led to the most violent domestic attack on one of America's three branches of government.\n\n\"Senators, we are in a dialogue with history, a conversation with our past, with a hope for our future,\" said Rep.

Below, read our entire Q&A with the movie's executive producers.\n\nWhy did you decide to recast Harry and Meghan for each of the three movies?\n\nMW: Well, after the first film—we loved working with Parisa [Fitz-Henley] and with Murray [Fraser]—Parisa actually went off to do a bunch of feature films, so Parisa was just unavailable. So, after that first one we were just sort of put in a position of having to recast.\n\nMF: We were like, \"Nobody could ever do it!\" We were so in love with Parisa and Murray, we were like, \"It's impossible! How will we ever do it?\" But then it's like you're producers; you have to do it. You'll figure it out. Then it was just so exciting to find a new duo who reinvented them in their own way. Then it was like, \"Oh, this is fun.\" We enjoy this part of it. And that couple and that bond they bring with them, that kind of magic that elevates the whole movie.\n\nMW: We were joking that this was going to be like our James Bond. After we had to recast after the first one, we were like OK, well then that's what we're gonna do for each of these movies.\n\nMF: Once we knew we wouldn't have Parisa and Murray, we thought, \"well, let's keep as many of the other people as we can!\" Because we had such a great experience. It was so satisfying to make that first film, and we really loved our team. The director, writer, production designers, and other department heads and supporting cast are all the same. Because we were able to bring back so much of our whole team from the first one, I think it sort of set up this cool thing that happens with these movies when you add that new couple and what they bring to it.\n\nWhen casting parts that are based on real people, are you more focused on resemblance or acting chops?\n\nMW: I would say it is a balance of those things. It's not so much a lookalike, but they do have to remind me in some way of that person. Sometimes it's their voice, sometimes it's their manner. It's that mixed with wanting to get people who are good actors. I think we lucked out because [Sydney Morton and Jordan Dean] are both such good actors—and happened to look like Harry and Meghan.\n\nMF: There are more people than you'd think that look like any of us. When you actually go looking at actors, there are enough people that resemble other people. One might resemble them in one way and another might in another way. Like for example, Sydney's voice is so much like Meghan Markle's voice. I don't think that was particularly true of the other actresses [who played Meghan]. Certainly, each of them did their work to prepare for that role and work their voices, but I think Sydney had that natural Meghan Markle voice. I think that goes a long way with her performance. She doesn't have the stature, she's a tinier person, but there are things she does with the performance that sell you on her version of the Meghan Markle character. I think each of the actresses act on different points of that character.\n\nMW: I think we lucked out in that Sydney and Jordan are both Broadway actors. We didn't find out this out until after we had cast them both, but they had worked together. They were friends and had worked together on American Psycho on Broadway in 2016.\n\nMF: It wasn't something we had planned, but it was like the happiest accident in the world that they already had that chemistry.\n\nHow do you create robust, relatable characters out of figures who have such monitored public personas?\n\nMW: It's true that what they say goes through a process. It's not off the cuff, but they've spoken at events and charities and in circumstances that are important to them. I guess we've sort of felt like we've listened to what they've said. We've really tried to look at what have they chosen to do and say. And there have been a couple of times certainly where they've spoken, and it's been clearly from the heart. And obviously recently with the Oprah interview and things outside of palace purview..."}

The nutjob. The skank. The slut who won't shut up. I'm the psycho liar paid by the Democratic Party. I'm the loony who deserves the death threats. I'm the kook who has it coming. I'm so nasty that @BluMrln75 says Trump wouldn't do me \"with Biden's wiener.\" And don't say you don't remember me, reader. I'm the batshit flaky bitch who warned you that Trump won't take \"no\" for an answer.\n\nAnd did you listen? Did you? Cuz now Trump won't take \"no\" from America.

He sulks, he incites, he shakes the Capitol down to the core of its spleen, and still he won't take \"no.\" So as we approach January 20, when his foul body may or may not be dragged from the White House, I thought I would just remind everyone that all this could have been avoided if everybody had simply listened, and not just to me, but to the first woman who publicly accused Trump of sexual assault two decades ago.\n\nFor six straight years she said \"no\" to Trump, she told me, and for six straight years Trump chased her, pulled her into rooms, unbuttoned his pants, phoned her, called her boyfriend a loser, and begged her to get on a plane and fly to New York, swearing over and over that he would \"be the best lover she'd ever have\" and promising, \"After me, baby, you're gonna be ruined for anyone else for the rest of your life.\"\n\n2.\n\nReader, exhibit number one is a lawsuit filed on April 30, 1997, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Allegations: Sexual harassment, sexual assault, attempted rape, sexual subjugation, and defamation. Request for compensation: $125 million. Complaint: Jury trial demanded. And if any man in history deserves to be tried by a jury—of about 167 million women—it is Trump. So now let us find out how this happened.\n\nJill Harth grows up in Massapequa Park, Long Island, a bunny-loving, Girl Scout–cookie-selling, lightning-bug-catching lass who, by the age of 12, is stuffed to the gills with the romance magazines her grandmother feeds her.\n\nAt Berner High School, home of the Fighting Baldwin Brothers (Jill and Danny Baldwin attend at the same time), she is not popular. She has acne. She does not make the softball team. Her favorite book is Designing Your Face, by Way Bandy. She begins mixing cosmetics to hide her pimples and experimenting with skin-care concoctions in the family kitchen. With her dad, a Rheingold Beer truck driver, yelling, What's all this oatmeal clogging the sink?, an entrepreneur is born.\n\nDo Jill Harth Beauty Cosmetics & Skincare products work? I'd better tell you right away: I look like Miss Havisham when I arrive at Jill's digs. These days, she owns a cozy apartment in the quaint part of Queens, the part that looks so much like King Henry VIII's England, all that's missing is a block for Anne Boleyn to put her head on.\n\nAfter we eat the guacamole that Jill makes, and after we have a long jaw in her mauve boudoir, Jill—a hell of a makeup artist with a bizarre client list, everyone from Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michelle Pfeiffer to Bill de Blasio and George Conway—asks me to remove my COVID mask. She studies my mug for a few seconds, then hands me a lipstick called \"Natalie\" (Jill names her lipsticks after movie stars), which I proceed to slather on. Jill's mother, the jaunty Grace Harth, a former bus driver who is defying doctors' predictions of being dead and gone on account of advanced Parkinson's disease, and who is, instead, propped up in freshly laundered sheets on a giant hospital bed in the middle of Jill's living room, gazes at me and clasps her hands together. \"Oh, Jill,\" she says with heavenly pride. \"Jean looks soooo much better!\"\n\nNow back to Jill's claims in that court document.\n\n3.\n\nStatement of facts: On or about December 11, 1992, the plaintiff accompanied George Houraney to make a business presentation to the defendant, Donald J.

It reflects a rare victory in the fight against ransomware as U.S. officials scramble to confront a rapidly accelerating threat targeting critical industries around the world.\n\n\"By going after the entire ecosystem that fuels ransomware and digital extortion attacks — including criminal proceeds in the form of digital currency — we will continue to use all of our resources to increase the cost and consequences of ransomware and other cyber-based attacks,\" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at a news conference announcing the operation.\n\nGeorgia-based Colonial Pipeline, which supplies roughly half the fuel consumed on the East Coast, temporarily shut down its operations on May 7 after a gang of cybercriminals using the DarkSide ransomware variant broke into the company's computer system. The ransomware variant used by DarkSide, which has been the subject of an FBI investigation since last year, is one of more than 100 that law enforcement officials are now scrutinizing, said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate.\n\nColonial officials have said they took their pipeline system offline before the attack could spread to its operating system, and decided soon after to pay ransom of 75 bitcoin — then valued at roughly $4.4 million — in hopes of bringing itself back online as soon as it could. The company's president and chief executive, Joseph Blount, is set to testify before congressional panels this week.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Blount said he was grateful for the FBI's efforts and said holding hackers accountable and disrupting their activities \"is the best way to deter and defend against future attacks of this nature.\n\n\"The private sector also has an equally important role to play and we must continue to take cyber threats seriously and invest accordingly to harden our defenses,\" he added.\n\nCryptocurrency is favored by cybercriminals because it enables direct online payments regardless of geographical location, but in this case, the FBI was able to identify a virtual currency wallet used by the hackers and recovered the proceeds from there, said the FBI's Abbate. The Justice Department did not provide details about how the FBI had obtained a \"key\" for the specific bitcoin address, but said law enforcement had been able to track multiple transfers of the cryptocurrency."}

The IRS has distributed more than 156 million of these payments and is continuing to steadily deposit money into people's bank accounts or mail out checks.\n\nIf you haven't yet received your third check, you can use the IRS's Get My Payment tool to determine when your money will arrive.\n\nIf you didn't receive either the first or second check, though, the IRS will no longer send the payment to you automatically. You are going to have to claim it by filing your 2020 taxes if you didn't receive your money. Here's what you should know about this process.\n\nClaiming your stimulus check on a tax return\n\nIf you didn't receive the full amount of stimulus payments that were authorized in 2020, you'll need to use Line 30 of the 1040 (or 1040-SR) form in order to request your money.\n\nWhen you request the outstanding stimulus payments, you'll need to know how much you are entitled to receive. The IRS instructions accompanying the 1040 form include a worksheet that can help you to figure that out.

Answers to your COVID-19 relief questions\n\nDid you lose your job in 2020?: You may be eligible for extra stimulus money\n\nIn order to calculate the amount of stimulus money you're owed, you will need to know how much you have already received (if anything). You can sign into your IRS account (or create one) to see how much you have been paid already in order to correctly determine your outstanding balance.\n\nThe IRS should have also sent you two documents detailing the amount of your payments: Notice 1444 which provides information on your first payment and Notice 1444-B which shows how much your second payment was for.\n\nOnce you've calculated your credit and submitted a tax return requesting the unpaid funds, the IRS will also calculate the amount of the credit they believe you are due. If the amount you requested in stimulus funds doesn't match up with what the agency expects to pay, this can result in a small delay in the processing of your refund.\n\nNo IRS stimulus check?: If you haven't gotten the third COVID-19 relief payment, you're not completely out of luck\n\nIf the IRS adjusts the amount of stimulus money you'll receive after you've filed your returns, you will receive a letter from the agency explaining the discrepancy and why the IRS corrected the amount."}

The outage left them stranded.\n\nBut this crucial question would go unanswered for hours, after all Facebook's services—including Facebook.com, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram—suddenly became unavailable from around 11:40 a.m. US Eastern time. The outage was due to changes to Facebook's backbone routers, the firm said in a blog post. Those changes meant that traffic was not being handled properly by the Domain Name System (DNS), a tool that directs traffic and tracks addresses across the internet. In total, Facebook's apps and sites were down for almost six hours.\n\nFor many internet users in the United States, the outage was a minor annoyance. But for the millions of people around the world who rely on Facebook's products to access the internet, including Afghans that already feel abandoned by the international community's withdrawal in mid-August, the sudden downtime was far more serious.\n\nFor much of the world, Facebook has become \"synonymous with the internet,\" says Sarah Aoun, vice president for security at the Open Technology Fund, a US nonprofit that supports technology projects like the private browser Tor and encrypted message service Signal. That made the outage the equivalent of nothing less than \"a big infrastructure collapse,\" she says.\n\nThe outage also came at an inauspicious time for Facebook. On Sunday, just hours before the outage, the CBS television program 60 Minutes aired a highly anticipated interview with a Facebook whistleblower, Frances Haugen, who has leaked a number of documents suggesting the firm knew that its products were bad for teen girls, among other revelations. She is due to testify before the US Senate later today. Facebook is also fighting an antitrust investigation in the US that could force it to sell Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nFacebook's internet\n\nMore than 3.5 billion people around the world use Facebook's suite of social networks and apps, including Facebook.com, Messenger app, Instagram, and WhatsApp, among others. The country with the largest population of Facebook users is India, with an estimated 340 million users. (The United States, by contrast, has an estimated 200 million users.)\n\nThis was by design. For years, Facebook has been working to expand internet access in the developing world—which would also expand its own user base. The company has explored the use of satellites, drones, and radio-linked wireless networks. It has partnered with local telecommunication firms to improve physical internet infrastructure.\n\nIn 2013 Facebook launched Internet.org, an initiative that allowed users to access Facebook, and certain other websites, without incurring any data charges. This was part of Mark Zuckerberg's grand plan to get the world online by providing internet access to the 85% of the world (at the time) that had access to cellular data."}

Why was it so easy for rioters to get past security? Why didn't Capitol Police have more officers in the building and at the entrances? What must terrorists think of our seat of government's security?\n\nThe presidential inauguration is only days away. There must be better security for that event than what we saw Wednesday.\n\nPolitical violence is inexcusable, no matter who is committing it, and public safety is crucial to protect individual freedoms and equal protection under the law.\n\nWhile Black Lives Matter protests have sometimes turned violent, and Antifa has a long history of association with violence, pro-Trump demonstrations have mostly been peaceful in the past. This may have put Capitol Police in an erroneously relaxed posture.\n\nBut public safety officials must always be prepared for the possibility that instigators and political opportunists might goad a crowd to violence.\n\nWashington has dozens of law enforcement agencies, each with different jurisdictions. But unlike the other agencies that report to the city or the federal executive branch, Capitol Police are part of the legislative branch. They report to congressional leaders.\n\nThe day of the riot, Capitol Police was worked with the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department, the U.S. Secret Service (a division of the Department of Homeland Security), and U.S. Park Police (a division of the Interior Department), as it commonly does, to make our public spaces secure, accessible, and protect the process of democracy.\n\nCapitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who resigned Thursday effective Jan. 16, stated that the Capitol attack was unlike anything he had ever experienced in his 30 years of law enforcement in Washington. Rioters attacked Capitol Police officers and other uniformed law enforcement officers with metal pipes, chemical irritants, and other weapons.\n\n\"They were determined to enter into the Capitol Building by causing great damage,\" Sund said.\n\nMore than 50 Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police Department officers sustained injuries during the attack on the Capitol.\n\nSeveral Capitol Police officers were hospitalized with serious injuries, and one officer died of his injuries, in addition to the Trump supporter who was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer.\n\nLaw enforcement in Washington often has to maintain law and order while allowing Americans to practice their First Amendment rights. In many scenarios, this is a challenging balance to strike.\n\nSund's description of the clashes with Capitol Police sounds familiar because it is. The tactics used in the riot last week resemble those used in riots that occurred in multiple cities throughout 2020. Law enforcement officers and buildings around the U.S. have been attacked with pipes, rocket-grade fireworks, and other dangerous weapons since May by Antifa and Black Lives Matter criminals.\n\nThe difference is the 2020 riots occurred in the dark of night and most of the mainstream media showed little of the rioters' violence, downplaying the attacks as \"peaceful protests.\"\n\nSlowly, information is coming forward that bad actors at prior riots were involved at the Capitol riot as well. Some rioters wore the typical black bloc garb and helmets, others donned Trump paraphernalia to blend in. At a minimum, Wednesday's assault on the Capitol was fully informed by the lessons of previous actions.\n\nThe rioters had watched the tactics and techniques of the Antifa criminals (which included violence, weapons, and destruction) and the nearly non-existent legal repercussions meted out by liberal city and state governments (the vast majority of criminals who were arrested were released without charges), as well as the validation the earlier rioters received (such as having streets named for them).\n\nIt is critical that Capitol Police and other law enforcement prepare for Inauguration Day and other mass demonstrations where opinions are strongly divided, causing emotions to run high, by using the successful enforcement tactics during the 2020 riots.\n\nFortunately, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and Capitol Police have started doing so.\n\nDuring the Capitol riot, additional National Guard units were called in; Bowser set a curfew and extended her emergency order for 15 days, which will cover the inauguration.\n\nAt the request of Capitol Police, Homeland Security installed additional protective fencing Thursday around the perimeter of the Capitol grounds, a tactic the department used to protect U.S. courthouses and other federal property in Portland, Oregon, and other cities during the 2020 riots.\n\nMeanwhile, law enforcement agencies have made dozens of arrests and requested information on numerous individuals photographed inside the Capitol."}

I mean, it's the perfect weapon, as David Sanger says, it's a short-of-war weapon,\" Helima Croft, a member of the National Petroleum Council and the Global Head of Commodity Strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said on \"CBS This Morning\" Wednesday. \"We are talking about an energy story this week. The question is will we be talking about, you know, the electricity supply, will we be talking about the water supply. So I think, again, this is a story about energy this week, about gas lines, but the cyber story and story of cyberattacks is not going to go away.\"\n\nColonial Pipeline, which supplies about 45% of the East Coast's total fuel, was hit by hacker group DarkSide Friday, forcing it to shut down operations.\n\n\"You have a number of state actors, non-state actors being able to use this technology to wreak havoc on critical infrastructure across the world,\" she said.\n\nWhile a large part of the system is back online and more is expected to be restarted by the end of the week, gas prices in several states have spiked to a nearly seven-year high and according to Gas Buddy, about 1,800 stations across the U.S. are out of fuel.\n\nCroft expects prices to stay elevated until the company announces it is fully back online — but low prices this season are unlikely.\n\n\"We've had this recovery from COVID. People are driving again. People are getting on planes again. But certainly the spike that we've seen that has been driven by this cyberattack, we think that will be mitigated soon,\" she said.\n\nExperts say the shortages are primarily because of panic buying and people hoarding gasoline.\n\nThe last major cyberattack to hit the U.S. was in early 2020, when hackers believed to be linked to Russian intelligence infiltrated the Texas-based company SolarWinds. The attack sent malicious code that infected more than 18,000 private and government users of SolarWinds' software.\n\nThe problem, Croft said, is that 85% of \"critical American infrastructure\" is privately owned. Those companies are not required to disclose all cyberattacks.\n\n\"They only have to do so, for example, if social security numbers are compromised,\" she said. \"The federal government is really trying to work with these companies to provide more information about what is actually happening, and really trying to work with these companies to bolster their cyber defenses.\"\n\nShe said ransomware hacks cost American companies $20 billion last year."}

Some of that ire is directed squarely at Harris' chief of staff, Tina Flournoy, those people said. Another source close to the staff said there were \"challenges and struggles\" and heard complaints about Flournoy from staff, but denied it amounted to dysfunction or that the tensions were directly Flournoy's fault.\n\nSabrina Singh, deputy press secretary to the vice president, told CNN in a statement that Harris' focus remains on her work.\n\n\"The Vice President and her office are focused on the Biden-Harris Administration's agenda to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down, to making sure racial equity is at the core of everything the Administration does, to combatting the existential threat of climate change, and to continue protecting the American people from the Covid-19 pandemic,\" Singh said.\n\nAnd White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Friday said, \"I will say that the vice president is an incredibly important partner to the President of the United States. She has a challenging job, a hard job, and she has a great supportive team of people around her. But other than that, I'm not going to have any more comments on those reports.\"\n\nStill, conversations are now underway in the West Wing about how to better support Harris' team, one source close to the White House said.\n\nThat help from the West Wing is a sign that the spiraling narrative could start to affect Harris, who is considered the next in line to lead the Democratic Party – with a potential for a presidential run coming as soon as 2024 if President Joe Biden decides not to seek reelection. Biden has said he does intend to run.\n\nTop White House officials and aides to the vice president went on the record to defend Harris and Flournoy, calling reports of infighting and dysfunction overblown or simply untrue. And Harris' outside allies and advisers – like influential adviser Minyon Moore and Democratic strategist Bakari Sellers – quickly took to Twitter, looking to drown out the criticism.\n\nOn Friday, Biden's chief of staff, Ron Klain, a longtime friend of Flournoy, said in a statement to CNN: \"Vice President Harris and her team are off to the fastest and strongest start of any Vice President I have seen. She's Delivering for the American people on immigration, small business, voting rights, and economic growth. The President's trust and confidence in her is obvious when you see them in the Oval Office together.\"\n\n\"The results speak for themselves: a decline of border arrivals from the Northern Triangle, improved vaccine equity, and increased economic opportunities for women. Anyone who has the honor of working closely with the Vice President knows how her talents and determination have made a huge difference in this Administration already,\" Klain's statement added."}

The total amount of login credentials (8,459,060,239 unique entries) it contains is almost double the amount of estimated internet users in the world, meaning that there are likely duplicate accounts as well as possible new connections between compromised usernames and related email addresses. It is unclear if the Colonial Pipeline hackers obtained the login that they used to breach the network from this leak specifically, but the compromised VPN password was found in one of the collections of dark web password leaks that comprises RockYou2021.\n\nPassword leak brings together many prior major breaches, makes \"brute force\" and fraud attempts easier\n\nThe 100GB \"RockYou2021\" TXT file was leaked to a dark web forum. Its 8.4 billion passwords are 6-20 characters long, with non-ASCII characters and white spaces removed. While security researchers are still poring through the contents, it is safe to assume that it combines credentials found in prior unrelated password leaks.\n\nThe name is a reference to the RockYou password leak of 2009, at the time the largest of its type. Hackers were able to breach the servers of the now-defunct RockYou social network service, accessing some 32 million usernames and passwords that were dumped in a text file named \"rockyou2021.txt\".\n\nWhile the new password leak likely contains little (if anything) in the way of new compromised accounts, it serves as a convenience tool for threat actors to try things like \"brute force\" and \"spray and pray\" login attacks. Saumitra Das, CTO and Cofounder, Blue Hexagon, added: \"Any password leaks of large volumes are always alarming to hear and should be taken seriously; our own investigation of this report has shown that quite a large number of accounts passwords are recycled from previous breaches and not necessarily active.\"\n\nThe information is very likely to be put to use in spam and phishing campaigns. It outstrips the largest prior combination file of this type, the Compilation of Many Breaches (COMB), which contained 3.2 billion leaked passwords."}

Your leadership is so inspiring, and the whole group of women and men and the community leaders that — that really have been a voice on these issues for so long. For so long. And you hold us to be accountable. And I'm glad to say today we're about to announce that we are taking that charge seriously and have heard you. But please continue with your leadership because it's so important. So, thank you.\n\nAnd good morning, everyone. It is great to be in the house of labor. (Applause.) Good morning. (Laughs.) Good morning. And it's so good to be here at the AFL-CIO.\n\nYou know, the last time I was in this building was in August, and it was early in the morning. My husband, Doug, and I came here to pay our respects and say goodbye to the late, great Rich Trumka. And as we all know, he was a man who lived and breathed solidarity.\n\nAnd I remember that morning because we wanted to just come in and be lowkey. And — and so we walked in the door and there was Liz Shuler. And she greeted me with a big ole warm hug, and we talked that day about Rich's legacy, about the tremendous mark he made and left on our nation.\n\nAnd, Liz, we also talked about the future because that's what I believe Rich would have wanted. And we talked in a way that was not only the focus on what we have achieved, but we talked about what we still have yet to do. And Liz knows what we must do.\n\nWe have worked together for some time now, and I will tell you Liz knows we must protect the rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain. She knows we must strengthen those rights. She knows we cannot let up or ever accommodate any amount of progress. We must stay vigilant. And she knows that the Biden-Harris administration will always stand in solidarity with the American labor movement. (Applause.)\n\nSo you all know, and the President and I have been clear: We are determined and we are proud say, perhaps sometimes with a bit of bravado, that we will be the most pro-labor union administration in America's history — (applause) — and we are proud of that. And we are proud of that.\n\nAnd it's for good reason. Because we're clear: When union wages go up, everybody's wages go up. When union jobs are safer, our communities are safer. And when union members go to work, they go to work for all of us. They teach our students and care for our patients. They lay broadband lines and manufacture electric vehicles. And union members replace lead pipes –- (applause) — which is what brings me here today.\n\nOver the years, I have traveled around the country and I have met many parents to talk about this very issue –- so many parents –- parents who are worried that every time they turned on the faucet to get their child a glass of water, that they may be filling that glass with poison; parents who worry, as they make breakfast in the morning or in the evening help their children to brush their teeth, that they are exposing their children to something that could harm them.\n\nAnd the science is clear about what drinking water from a lead pipe can do to the human body. For adults, it can cause an increase in blood pressure and decrease kidney function. For children, it can severely harm mental and physical development. It can stunt growth, slow down learning, and cause irreparable damage to the brain.\n\nSo, the bottom line is that there is no reason in the 21st century for why people are still exposed to this substance that was poisoning people back in the 18th century. There is no good reason."}

However, if you're behind on certain debts, including child support and back taxes, you may get a smaller tax return than you expect depending on how much you owe.\n\nWhile the CARES Act only made the first $1,200 stimulus exempt from state and federal garnishment (with the exception of child support), the terms of the $900 billion Covid relief bill passed in December protected the second round of stimulus checks from garnishment by all creditors, including private ones.\n\nHowever, tax refunds are treated differently. If you're getting your stimulus payment in the form of a tax rebate, the amount may be reduced to pay debts owed. The Treasury Offset Program (TOP) is allowed to withhold money from your tax return for the following reasons:\n\nBack taxes owed from previous years\n\nPast-due federal student loans (currently suspended through Sept. 30, 2021)\n\nPast-due court-ordered child support payments\n\nOutstanding debts with federal agencies other than the IRS\n\nPast-due state income taxes\n\nAny unemployment compensation you must pay back\n\nThe IRS has agreed that it will not offset your stimulus rebate to pay for federal tax debts, but the agency cannot extend this discretion for state and other federal agencies.\n\nAs for upcoming payments, under the terms of the American Rescue Plan, your $1,400 stimulus check cannot be garnished for unpaid federal or state debt. However, the money may be garnished for unpaid private debts, such as medical bills or credit card debts, provided they are subject to a court order. And like with 2020 taxes, if you get your $1,400 stimulus check in the form of a tax rebate, the same offsets above could be possible.\n\nSome consumer advocacy and banking groups are calling on Congress to pass a standalone bill to make the latest stimulus payment exempt from garnishment. In a joint letter by the American Bankers Association, Americans for Financial Reform and other groups, consumer advocates argue that allowing garnishment impacts struggling families the most and fails to carry out the objective of stimulus payments in the first place.\n\nIf you're still awaiting your third stimulus payment, you may track it using the IRS Get My Payment site."}

But still the ship veered from one side of the channel to the other. Each time he turned the wheel, the helmsman was able to bring the ship temporarily back toward the correct heading, but too-aggressive rudder commands caused it to overshoot the mark. Instead of settling down, the ship's swings were getting wilder.\n\nAt 7:38 a.m., as it approached the irrigated fruit-tree groves of the Al Ganayen district, the Ever Given veered toward the left bank, skimmed alongside it, then jerked hard to the right. The overcorrection was so severe that the bow swung toward the opposite bank like a harpoon. This time there was neither time nor room to undo the swerve. The bulb-shaped tip of Ever Given's bow plunged 50 feet deep into the mud and sand of the canal bank. Maintaining its momentum, the stern swung around toward the far bank until it, too, was firmly lodged.\n\nKanthavel's reaction: \"Shit.\"\n\nHalf a mile behind, on the bridge of the container ship Maersk Denver, marine engineer Julianne Cona aimed her camera forward and snapped an image of the Ever Given's hull stretching from bank to bank. \"From the looks of it,\" she wrote on Instagram, \"that ship is super stuck.\"\n\nEveryone wanted to know how it happened and who was to blame. It wasn't merely a craving for lurid details; understanding how accidents happen is essential to making sure they don't happen again. This is why around the world, transportation safety agencies carry out investigations and issue recommendations for rule changes. Egypt's, unfortunately, does not have a great track record. Accidents that occur under its purview tend to be enmeshed in intrigue and controversy. More than 1,000 of the 1,400 ferry passengers on the al-Salam Boccaccio 98 died when it sank in the Red Sea in 2006. The government initially blamed the captain, but a subsequent parliamentary investigation laid the blame on the ferry's owner, Mamdouh Ismail, a businessman and politician with close ties to then president Hosni Mubarak. Acquitted in a 2008 trial, he was later retried, convicted, and sentenced to seven years in prison, though he never served time, and the conviction was later erased.\n\nWith the Ever Given, the Egyptian government evinced no doubt as to who was responsible. Within hours, it declared, with no evidence, that the ship had run aground due to an engine failure. After it became clear that this was not true, Egypt asserted that the captain was to blame for sailing at such high speed. In response, the ship's insurers issued a statement pointing out that when a ship is traveling through the canal in a convoy its speed \"is controlled by the Suez Canal pilots and SCA vessel traffic management services.\"\n\nThe pilot would get on board and the first thing he would do is ask for a couple of cartons of cigarettes. The electricians are going to want a carton. And the tugboats, if you need tugboats, they're going to want that carton.

If that's all that matters to you — and that's a pretty good argument — then he's the greatest quarterback of all-time.\n\nPeyton Manning will almost certainly be announced as a hall of famer on Saturday night. The argument of who is better is closer than you think.\n\nBrady vs. Manning by the numbers\n\nAn average season for Manning was an 11-5 record, completing 65.3% of his passes for 4,231 yards, 32 touchdowns and 15 interceptions with a 96.5 passer rating. Brady is at 12-4, completing 64.0% of his passes for 4,210 yards, 31 touchdowns and 10 interceptions with a 97.3 passer rating.\n\nManning set the single-season touchdown passes record with 49 in 2004, Brady threw 50 in 2007 then Manning had 55 in 2013. Manning owns the passing yards record with 5,477 in 2013 and his passer rating of 121.1 in 2004 is No. 3 all-time.

Manning is No. 3 in passing yards (71,940), No. 3 in TDs (539) and 11th in passer rating (96.5). Manning's passer rating is 17% better than the league average during his career, Brady's 15%. (Sid Luckman was 58% better than the average quarterback during his career, by the way.)\n\nManning's biggest edge on Brady is his seven first-team All-Pro seasons, Johnny Unitas is next at five among quarterbacks. Brady had three. Manning also won a record five MVP awards, Brady three. For the people following the sports the closest during their careers, Manning was better than Brady during the regular season.\n\nEdge: Manning.

Brady was, of course, 11-6 against Manning, with a 92.8 passer rating.

Maxine Waters on Saturday night called for protesters to \"stay on the street\" and \"get more confrontational\" if former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is acquitted in the killing of George Floyd.\n\nThe comments by Waters, a California Democrat and icon among progressives, were immediately seized on by Republicans who claimed that Waters was inciting violence. The congresswoman denied in a subsequent interview that she was encouraging violence, but the remarks come at a time of immense national tension amid several high-profile killings of Black people at the hands of police officers and as American cities brace for a fresh wave of protests as the Chauvin trial nears a close.\n\nWaters said she was in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, on Saturday night to show her support for protesters amid ongoing protests over the police killing of Daunte Wright and to also support his family.\n\n\"We've got to stay in the street and demand justice,\" Waters said to reporters, according to video posted on social media.\n\n\"We're looking for a guilty verdict and we're looking to see if all of the talk that took place and has been taking place after they saw what happened to George Floyd. If nothing does not happen, then we know that we got to not only stay in the street, but we have got to fight for justice,\" she added.\n\nAsked what protesters should do if there is no guilty verdict, Waters said protests should continue.\n\n\"We got to stay on the street. And we've got to get more active, we've got to get more confrontational. We've got to make sure that they know that we mean business,\" she said.\n\nAsked about the curfew put in place, Waters said, \"I don't think anything about curfew. Curfew means I want you all to stop talking. I want you to stop meeting. I want you to stop gathering. I don't agree with that.\"\n\nThe congresswoman's comments come at a particularly fraught time in the nation's history. Closing arguments are underway in Chauvin's trial, and protests continue over the killing of Wright. Authorities have ramped up security around Minneapolis, with crews installing razor wire around some police buildings and National Guard troops have been deployed in parts of the city's downtown.\n\nIn an interview with theGrio that was published on Monday morning, Waters said she was \"nonviolent\" and said her remark about being \"confrontational\" was in regard to changing the justice system in the US.\n\n\"I talk about confronting the justice system, confronting the policing that's going on, I'm talking about speaking up,\" she said. I'm talking about legislation. I'm talking about elected officials doing what needs to be done to control their budgets and to pass legislation.\"\n\nWaters told CNN on Monday evening that her reference to confrontation was meant in the context of the civil rights movement's nonviolent history, saying that \"the whole civil rights movement is confrontation.\" When pressed on the judge presiding over Chauvin's trial having said that her remarks could be grounds for an appeal, Waters replied, \"Oh no, no they didn't.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, Judge Peter Cahill referenced Waters' weekend comments, telling the defense that she \"may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned.\"\n\nJudge Peter Cahill, who is presiding over Chauvin's trial, referenced Waters' comments on Monday, telling the defense that she \"may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned.\"\n\n\"I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function,\" Cahill later added. \"I think if they want to give their opinions, they should do so in a respectful and in a manner that is consistent with their oath to the Constitution, to respect a coequal branch of government.\"\n\nHe added, \"Their failure to do so, I think, is abhorrent, but I don't think it's prejudiced us with additional material that would prejudice this jury.\"\n\nSwift criticism from GOP\n\nWaters' comments over the weekend drew swift criticism from several Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Rep.

But he declared that \"it's not enough.\"\n\nBiden spoke Tuesday from the White House hours after the verdict alongside Vice President Kamala Harris, with the pair saying the country's work is far from finished with the verdict.\n\n\"We can't stop here,\" Biden declared.\n\nBiden and Harris called on Congress to act swiftly to address policing reform, including by approving a bill named for Floyd, who died with his neck under Chauvin's knee last May. Beyond that, the president said, the entire country must confront hatred to \"change hearts and minds as well as laws and policies.\"\n\n\"'I can't breathe.' Those were George Floyd's last words,\" Biden said. \"We can't let those words die with him. We have to keep hearing those words. We must not turn away. We can't turn away.\"\n\nHarris, the first Black woman to serve as vice president, said racism was keeping the country from fulfilling its founding promise of \"liberty and justice for all.\"\n\n\"It is not just a Black America problem or a people of color problem. It is a problem for every American,\" she said. \"It is holding our nation back from reaching our full potential.\"\n\n\"A measure of justice isn't the same as equal justice,\" she said.\n\nBiden addressed the nation after telephoning Floyd's family following the verdict, telling them, \"We're all so relieved.\" He added later that he sought to comfort Floyd's young daughter Gianna, telling her, \"Daddy did change the world.\"\n\nAfter about 10 hours of deliberations over two days, the jury convicted Chauvin of two counts of murder and one of manslaughter.\n\nThe verdict — and the aftermath — will be a continuing test for Biden. He has pledged to help combat racism in policing, helping African Americans who supported him in large numbers in last year's election in the wake of protests that swept the nation after Floyd's death and restarted a national conversation about race. But he also has long projected himself as an ally of police, who are struggling with criticism about long-used tactics and training methods and difficulties in recruitment.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Biden broke his administration's silence on the trial, which has set the nation on edge for weeks, saying he was praying for \"the right verdict.\"\n\nSpeaking from the Oval Office while the jury was deliberating in Minneapolis, Biden said, \"I'm praying the verdict is the right verdict. I think it's overwhelming, in my view. I wouldn't say that unless the jury was sequestered now.\"\n\nThe president had repeatedly denounced Floyd's death but had previously stopped short of weighing in on Chauvin's trial, with White House officials saying it would be improper to speak out during active judicial proceedings. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki repeatedly refused to explain Biden's comments, doing nothing to dispel the impression that he thought Chauvin should be found guilty.\n\nThe White House had been privately weighing how to handle the verdict, dispatching specially trained community facilitators from the Justice Department in anticipation of potential protests, officials said. With word that a verdict had been reached Tuesday afternoon, Biden postponed planned remarks at the White House on his infrastructure package."}

That includes non-citizens.\n\nFor example, a citizen of Canada who is living and working full time in the U.S. would have a Social Security number and would be eligible for a stimulus payment.\n\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security website describes unauthorized immigrants as foreign-born non-citizens who live in the United States without legal residence.\n\nIndividuals who overstay their visas but pay tax in the United States using a Social Security number can be eligible for stimulus payments. The most recent available data for the number of visa overstays in the United States is from 2019, released by the Department of Homeland Security. It said that 1.21 percent of visas in that year were overstayed, or 676,422 overstays. In 2019, student visas (1.52 percent) had a higher overstay rate than those from Canada and Mexico (.75 percent, 1.27 percent, respectively).\n\nIllegal immigrants would not be eligible to receive a check if they do not have a Social Security number.\n\nImmigrants who overstay their visas no longer are lawfully in the country but retain their Social Security numbers and therefore are eligible to receive a check.\n\n\"Technically, if they have overstayed their visa, they are here illegally,\" a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection told Newsweek. \"If a visitor has not been granted an extension of status by USCIS [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services], then they are considered to be overstays and subject to deportable status under 237 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\"\n\nBut Durbin is not convinced that the number of overstays with Social Security cards is as high as Cruz said.\n\nA Durbin aide released a statement that said, in part:\n\n\"CBP's limited data sample of overstays and other estimates of visa overstay numbers do not contain the numbers of tax filers with SSNs who overstayed visas. It is simply false to assume that each visa overstayer has a social security number, for which the person must have been work-authorized to qualify for a SSN in the first place. By far the largest visa category of visas issued/visas overstayed each year (tourist/business B visas) according to DHS data do not qualify noncitizens to get a SSN.\n\n\"Generalized visa overstay estimates do not reveal how many individuals have overstayed visas who were a) authorized to work, b) provided the documentation necessary to get a Social Security Number, c) did not subsequently get a green card or otherwise obtain a lawful immigration status, d) overstayed their visa, but e) continued filing tax returns with the IRS such that they now qualify for stimulus checks.\n\n\"Additionally, a claim based on incomplete visa overstay data about the American Rescue Plan stimulus checks must also acknowledge that this hypothetical scenario (of stimulus checks going to visa overstayers with SSNs) would have applied just the same to the CARES Act and the December 2020 stimulus package, and is not a new or unique feature of the American Rescue Plan.\"\n\nPeople who qualify as legal residents include those who have passed the green card test (permanent legal residents) or those who pass the substantial presence test. That test requires taxpayers to be physically present in the United States for 31 days of the current year and 183 days for the past three years.\"\n\nAnyone who has a green card is considered a legal permanent resident, and would be eligible for the stimulus payment.\n\nThe Ruling\n\nTrue."}

Anna Wintour, Vogue editor-in-chef, and others defended the cover picture by noting that this image best reflects the events of the moment—but has now announced a re-do, with a new limited edition cover for Kamala Harris as a result of the widespread backlash. The cover photo controversy is much more than a disagreement over a styling choice. Madam Vice-President's racial identity is central to understanding why some take exception to this cover. Black women's bodies are political. Their styling choices have cultural meanings that are deeply rooted in cultural norms that carry the legacies of racism, sexism, and respectability politics. Thus, the uproar over Kamala Harris's Vogue cover must be read through a socio-cultural lens that acknowledges the intersectional salience of her racialized and gendered body.\n\nOutside of her historic victory, Kamala Harris's appearance also affords her some possibilities, such as this Vogue cover, not open to other Black women candidates.

ERCOT manages the flow of electric power in the state.\n\n\"Traffic lights and other infrastructure may be temporarily without power,\" ERCOT said.\n\nA level-three emergency notice was issued by the regulator, urging customers to limit power usage and prevent an uncontrolled system-wide outage.\n\nThe storms knocked out nearly half the wind power generation capacity of Texas on Sunday.\n\nWind generation ranks as the second-largest source of electricity in Texas, accounting for 23 percent of state power supplies last year behind natural gas, which served 45 percent, ERCOT estimates.\n\nEnergy traders last week said that some five-minute power prices in Texas approached $4,000 per megawatt hour. That compares with an ERCOT North average of $26 in 2020.\n\nNationwide storm\n\nApart from Texas, much of the US from the Pacific Northwest through the Great Plains and into the mid-Atlantic states has been in the grip of bone-chilling weather over the weekend, featuring snow, sleet and freezing rain.\n\nAround 5,000 Oklahoma Gas & Electric customers were without power overnight, and Entergy Arkansas logged about 3,000 outages.

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The attack killed more than 85 people, mostly students, as class let out Saturday. And at least 147 were wounded in the blast that left the building's outer wall pockmarked by shrapnel, according to the Mohammad Hedayt, the spokesman for Vice President Sarwar Danish.\n\nAfghanistan's Hazara community is frequently targeted by militant groups and was long persecuted by the Taliban. The scale and brutality of Saturday's attack left many Afghans and the international community stunned. Most of the victims were schoolgirls between 13 and 18 years old.\n\nDistrustful of the government and the Taliban, many of Afghanistan's minority groups, particularly the Hazaras, viewed the presence of foreign forces as protective. Following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, many Hazara militias disbanded, trusting that the new order would bring them safety. But now, as U.S. and NATO troops leave amid rising insecurity in the country, many Hazaras describe feeling abandoned, fearing a return to widespread persecution and an increase in attacks like Saturday's bombing.\n\nMukhtar Alizada's younger sister Nekbakht was one of the students killed. Grief-stricken, he described Nekbakht's infectious devotion to her studies. He said the 18-year-old would encourage her siblings to finish their homework and never to miss class.\n\n\"She would tell us we don't have to be poor like our parents; we don't have to be illiterate,\" he said. Nekbakht attended supplementary classes early in the morning before her afternoon classes at Syed Al-Shahda school. Between her studies, she would help her mother and sisters weave carpets at home to supplement her father's income as a day laborer.\n\n\"She had big dreams,\" her mother, Rahila Hydari, said.\n\nThe withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces has brought with it an uptick in violence across Afghanistan. Taliban attacks have hit small outposts around vulnerable government-held towns and cities, but Saturday's was one of the deadliest large-scale bombings targeting civilians in Kabul in months.\n\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the attack. The Taliban denied any involvement, but Afghan President Ashraf Ghani blamed the militants for the bombing, citing it as proof that they do not want a peaceful settlement to the conflict. Other experts warn that the more instability created in Afghanistan because of the withdrawal of foreign forces, the easier it will be for other militant groups such as the Islamic State to grow in strength.\n\nAn intense diplomatic push was launched earlier this year to reach a peace deal between the Taliban and the Afghan government to avoid the wave of violence now sweeping Afghanistan. The United States pressured the two sides to agree to a deal that included a cease-fire, but it was unsuccessful.\n\nNegotiations are ongoing. \"This is a pivotal moment for the Taliban and Afghan leadership to come together and take responsibility for the future of their country,\" the U.S. State Department said in a statement.\n\n\"We will do all we can to galvanize and support the diplomatic process. That includes negotiations between Afghan leaders and the Taliban and the meaningful participation and inclusion of women, minorities and civil society,\" the statement said.\n\nIn recent years, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for attacks targeting civilians in western Kabul, a neighborhood that is home to many ethnic Hazaras and Shiites, whom the militants view as heretics. A wedding hall bombing, a shooting at a religious gathering and a suicide attack on a gym are just some of the Kabul attacks the Islamic State has claimed.\n\nLast year, gunmen stormed a maternity ward in western Kabul, killing 16 people, including two newborns. That attack also went unclaimed: The Taliban denied responsibility, and the government blamed the militants.\n\nDespite the risks, Nekbakht's parents intend to send their other daughters back to Syed Al-Shahda once it reopens. They cannot afford to move to another neighborhood, and they say education is the only way they can ensure their children will have a better life and perhaps be able to flee Afghanistan one day.\n\n\"I want my children to be teachers or doctors so they can leave this country,\" said Hydari, Nekbakht's mother. Alizada, her brother, conceded, \"now that the U.S. troops are leaving, we fear the situation for Hazaras may get even worse.\"\n\nAlong with Afghan journalists and civil society activists whom the Taliban has threatened, many Hazaras are also attempting to flee.\n\nJawad Zawulistani, a 28-year-old Hazara working for a local human rights NGO, said he refuses to abandon his home country, but many of his friends are leaving or trying to plot an exit."}

New York County is currently approved for Public Assistance only. Governor Hochul and the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services continue to work with federal, state, and local partners to ensure New Yorkers are provided with the resources and assistance to fully recover from the devastating effects of Hurricane Ida.\n\nNew Yorkers who have been displaced, including uninsured families, will be eligible for funds for housing assistance, as well as crisis counseling, unemployment assistance, home repairs and legal services.\n\n\"Nassau County families and communities were hit particularly hard by the remnants of Ida, and I want to commend the hardworking damage assessment teams on the ground who provided information to secure this important federal disaster assistance,\" Governor Hochul said. \"I thank President Biden and FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell for their continued support in helping New Yorkers recover from these devastating floods.\n\nNassau County Executive Laura Curran said, \"I fought hard to ensure Nassau was included in FEMA's disaster declaration because too many families in our County continue to suffer. I thank Governor Kathy Hochul for her extraordinary efforts and leadership during this time, along with all our partners on the federal level. I urge anyone in Nassau who was affected by the remnants of Ida to visit FEMA's website and begin the application process as soon as possible.\"\n\nA Major Disaster Declaration allows for financial assistance from the federal government for local communities and individual New Yorkers to continue their recovery. Assistance includes funding for emergency protective measures, debris removal and repairs to public buildings and infrastructure, as well as direct support for individuals and homeowners. New Yorkers may also be able to receive funds for other uninsured or under-insured disaster-caused expenses and serious needs, such as repair or replacement of personal property or funds for moving and storage, or medical, dental, and child care. Homeowners and renters should make every effort to document their losses.\n\nEligible homeowners will work directly with FEMA to obtain funding. Assistance can include funds for temporary housing units, housing and driveway repairs, crisis counseling, unemployment assistance and legal services.\n\nThe New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services deployed specialists to assess damage in order to apply for federal disaster aid. The state remained in constant contact with FEMA and local partners throughout this process to push for an expedited review on the federal side once the preliminary damage assessments were finalized.\n\nState and federal experts have estimated the storm has now caused more than $140 million in damage to public infrastructure and property and more than 2,900 homes suffered damage.\n\nFunding to support the restoration of public infrastructure will come through FEMA's Public Assistance Program, which provides reimbursement for local governments after a disaster has been declared by U.S. President for activities such as debris removal, emergency protective measures, repair and rebuilding of publicly-owned infrastructure that was damaged including roads, schools, bridges, parks, hospitals, police stations, fire houses, water and waste water treatment facilities and other public facilities.\n\nGovernor Hochul previously announced the launch of the new online resource hub for impacted New Yorkers, available at ny.gov/Ida. The hub provides information on available assistance programs and where to find services such as shelter and access to food. Information on the site will be updated as more resources for New Yorkers become available. Additionally, the State is partnering with New York City to support Recovery Service Centers, which enlist the support of elected officials who represent impacted communities and provide information on available resources and assistance.\n\nGovernor Hochul also directed that $378 million in previously awarded hazard mitigation funding from FEMA be devoted to bolstering New York State's infrastructure against extreme weather."}

That may have altered jurors' expectations, too.\n\n\"There seems to be this growing expectation (among jurors) that if a defendant is on trial — he or she should fight for themselves and tell their story,\" he said.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Phil Turner said he wasn't convinced lawyers were changing their dim views overall about clients testifying.\n\n\"I would want to see a lot more trials to tell,\" he said.\n\nAT WHAT OTHER RECENT TRIALS HAVE DEFENDANTS TESTIFED?\n\nActor Jussie Smollett testified at his Chicago trial this month, telling jurors he told the truth about being the target of a racist, homophobic attack. Days later, jurors convicted him of lying to police.\n\nSo did Travis McMichael, a white man who fatally shot Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man, as Arbery ran empty-handed through a Georgia subdivision. He and two co-defendants were later convicted of murder.\n\nFormer Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes testified for seven days in November at her fraud and conspiracy trial in California. Her jury is still deliberating.\n\nPotter testified last week, sobbing as she described her horror at realizing she had shot Wright during a traffic stop.\n\nARE THERE STUDIES ON DEFENDANT TESTIMONY?\n\nThere's no recent data on percentages of defendants nationwide who have chosen to testify. That'll take years to compile. And studies on defendant testimony are few and far between.\n\nOne study of over 300 criminal trials published in the Cornell Law Review in 2009 found that some 77% of defendants who testified were found guilty. Among the defendants who chose not to testify, around 72% were convicted.\n\nA 1950s study by Harry Kalven and Hans Zeisel found that defendants without criminal records testified over 90% of the time and those with criminal histories testified around 70% of the time.\n\nDefendants with records are more reluctant to testify out of fear it'll enable prosecutors to expose the extent of their criminal pasts to jurors. The high-profile defendants who testified recently had no criminal records or minimal ones.\n\nWHAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE RECENT DECISIONS TO TESTIFY?\n\nBoth Rittenhouse and McMichael claimed self-defense, so their states of mind during the shootings were central to their trials. They had little choice but to testify since only they could tell jurors what they were thinking and feeling.\n\nRittenhouse conveyed that he feared for his life, breaking down on the stand as he described a protester he fatally shot charging at him. McMichael told jurors he was forced to open fire, alleging Arbery attacked him and grabbed his shotgun.\n\nAlthough it wasn't as crucial to their trials, Holmes and Potter also testified about their states of mind."}

Hundreds of people poured into the streets of Minneapolis, some running through traffic with banners. Drivers blared their horns in celebration.\n\n\"Today, we are able to breathe again,\" Floyd's younger brother Philonise said at a joyous family news conference where tears streamed down his face as he likened Floyd to the 1955 Mississippi lynching victim Emmett Till, except that this time there were cameras around to show the world what happened.\n\nOn Wednesday, Philonise Floyd described his thoughts while watching Chauvin being handcuffed. He recalled to ABC's \"Good Morning America\" how it appeared \"a lot easier\" on Chauvin than when his brother was handcuffed before his death, but said it still represented \"accountability.\"\n\n\"It makes us happier knowing that his life, it mattered, and he didn't die in vain,\" he said.\n\nThe jury of six whites and six Black or multiracial people came back with its verdict after about 10 hours of deliberations over two days. The now-fired white officer was found guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nChauvin's face was obscured by a COVID-19 mask, and little reaction could be seen beyond his eyes darting around the courtroom. His bail was immediately revoked. Sentencing will be in two months; the most serious charge carries up to 40 years in prison.\n\nDefense attorney Eric Nelson followed Chauvin out of the courtroom without comment.\n\nChauvin was booked soon after the verdicts were read into Minnesota's only maximum-security prison, Oak Park Heights, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Minneapolis. He is being held in a single cell under administrative segregation for his safety, Department of Corrections spokeswoman Sarah Fitzgerald said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden welcomed the verdict, saying Floyd's death was \"a murder in full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world\" to see systemic racism.\n\nBut he warned: \"It's not enough. We can't stop here. We're going to deliver real change and reform. We can and we must do more to reduce the likelihood that tragedies like this will ever happen again.\"\n\nThe jury's decision was hailed around the country as justice by other political and civic leaders and celebrities, including former President Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a white man, who said on Twitter that Floyd \"would still be alive if he looked like me. That must change.\"\n\nAt a park next to the Minneapolis courthouse, a hush fell over a crowd of about 300 as they listened to the verdict on their cellphones. Then a great roar went up, with many people hugging, some shedding tears.\n\nAt the intersection where Floyd was pinned down, a crowd chanted, \"One down, three to go!\" — a reference to the three other fired Minneapolis officers facing trial in August on charges of aiding and abetting murder in Floyd's death.\n\nJanay Henry, who lives nearby, said she felt grateful and relieved.\n\n\"I feel grounded. I can feel my feet on the concrete,\" she said, adding that she was looking forward to the \"next case with joy and optimism and strength.\"\n\nJamee Haggard, who brought her biracial 4-year-old daughter to the intersection, said: \"There's some form of justice that's coming.\"\n\nThe verdict was read in a courthouse ringed with concrete barriers and razor wire and patrolled by National Guard troops, in a city on edge against another round of unrest — not just because of the Chauvin case but because of the deadly police shooting of a young Black man, Daunte Wright, in a Minneapolis suburb April 11.\n\nThe jurors' identities were kept secret and will not be released until the judge decides it is safe to do so.\n\nIt is unusual for police officers to be prosecuted for killing someone on the job. And convictions are extraordinarily rare.\n\nOut of the thousands of deadly police shootings in the U.S. since 2005, fewer than 140 officers have been charged with murder or manslaughter, according to data maintained by Phil Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University. Before Tuesday, only seven were convicted of murder.\n\nJuries often give police officers the benefit of the doubt when they claim they had to make split-second, life-or-death decisions. But that was not an argument Chauvin could easily make."}

KFF analysis found that, following vaccine rollout in winter 2020-2021, weekly cases and deaths in long-term care facilities (including nursing homes, assisted living facilities, ICF/IIDs, and other settings) dropped, reaching an all-time low in June 2021, just prior to the rapid increase in national cases and deaths due to the Delta variant. As Delta spread across the US in the summer of 2021, much of the focus was on young children at risk during back-to-school; however, with the Delta surge, older Americans, especially those 85 and older, continued to face higher risk of death due to COVID-19 compared to younger Americans, according to the CDC. This data note analyzes federal nursing home data to determine the ongoing impact of the pandemic on COVID-19 cases and deaths among staff and residents. See methods box for more details.\n\nNursing homes across the US reported nearly 1,800 COVID-19 deaths among residents and staff in August 2021, the highest number of COVID-19 deaths reported in a single month since February 2021 and a steady increase from the approximately 350 deaths reported in July 2021 (Figure 1). This jump in the total number of deaths due to COVID-19 reverses the sustained pattern of decreasing deaths since CMS implemented the Pharmacy Partnership For Long-Term Care, even though the number of nursing home deaths due to COVID-19 in August 2021 was still far below the peak of over 22,000 seen in December 2020 (Table 1).\n\nDeaths attributable to COVID-19 increased at a faster rate in nursing homes than among all others in the community between July and August 2021. The number of COVID-19 deaths among staff and residents in nursing homes quadrupled between July and August, while COVID-19 deaths in the community doubled in the same time period (Table 1). During this period, deaths increased at a faster rate among nursing home residents than among nursing home staff (423% versus 274%). While the vast majority of COVID-19 deaths happened outside of nursing homes in July and August, the high rate of increase within nursing homes indicates that residents and staff in these settings are at risk of death during the Delta surge, and not immune from the most recent wave."}

(NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced results from a Phase 2/3 trial showing a favorable safety profile and robust neutralizing antibody responses in children 5 to 11 years of age using a two-dose regimen of 10 μg administered 21 days apart, a smaller dose than the 30 μg dose used for people 12 and older. The antibody responses in the participants given 10 μg doses were comparable to those recorded in a previous Pfizer-BioNTech study in people 16 to 25 years of age immunized with 30 μg doses. The 10 μg dose was carefully selected as the preferred dose for safety, tolerability and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age. These are the first results from a pivotal trial of a COVID-19 vaccine in this age group.\n\n\"Over the past nine months, hundreds of millions of people ages 12 and older from around the world have received our COVID-19 vaccine. We are eager to extend the protection afforded by the vaccine to this younger population, subject to regulatory authorization, especially as we track the spread of the Delta variant and the substantial threat it poses to children,\" said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. \"Since July, pediatric cases of COVID-19 have risen by about 240 percent in the U.S. – underscoring the public health need for vaccination. These trial results provide a strong foundation for seeking authorization of our vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old, and we plan to submit them to the FDA and other regulators with urgency.\"\n\n\"We are pleased to be able to submit data to regulatory authorities for this group of school-aged children before the start of the winter season,\" said Dr. Ugur Sahin, CEO and co-founder of BioNTech. \"The safety profile and immunogenicity data in children aged 5 to 11 years vaccinated at a lower dose are consistent with those we have observed with our vaccine in other older populations at a higher dose.\"\n\nThe data summarized from this Phase 2/3 study, which is enrolling children 6 months to 11 years of age, was for 2,268participants who were 5 to 11 years of age and received a 10 μg dose level in a two-dose regimen. In the trial, the SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing antibody geometric mean titer (GMT) was 1,197.6 (95% confidence interval [CI, 1106.1, 1296.6]), demonstrating strong immune response in this cohort of children one month after the second dose. This compares well (was non-inferior) to the GMT of 1146.5 (95% CI: 1045.5, 1257.2) from participants ages 16 to 25 years old, used as the control group for this analysis and who were administered a two-dose regimen of 30 μg. Further, the COVID-19 vaccine was well tolerated, with side effects generally comparable to those observed in participants 16 to 25 years of age.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech plan to share these data with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulators as soon as possible. For the United States, the companies expect to include the data in a near-term submission for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) as they continue to accumulate the safety and efficacy data required to file for full FDA approval in this age group. A request to the EMA to update the EU Conditional Marketing Authorization is also planned. Topline readouts for the other two age cohorts from the trial – children 2-5 years of age and children 6 months to 2 years of age – are expected as soon as the fourth quarter of this year."}

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Bill Cassidy, R-La., put forward one that would prevent $1,400 stimulus checks from going to prisoners. The amendment failed on a party-line vote.\n\nCotton tweeted that this was another example of spending tucked in the bill that had nothing to do with pandemic.\n\n\"Senate Democrats just voted to give stimulus checks to criminals in prison,\" he tweeted March 6. \"They haven't lost their jobs, they aren't worried about paying rent or buying groceries.\"\n\nSenate Democrats just voted to give stimulus checks to criminals in prison.\n\nThey haven't lost their jobs, they aren't worried about paying rent or buying groceries.\n\nCotton repeated his point March 8 on Fox News, saying \"every single Democrat\" wanted to send checks to prisoners — invoking Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Charleston, S.C., church shooter Dylann Roof.\n\nThe record shows that Democrats rejected the amendment to prevent payments to prisoners.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said it would harm prisoners' families.\n\n\"Given the stark racial disparities in our criminal justice system, this would cause the most harm to Black and brown families and communities already harmed by mass incarceration,\" Durbin said on the Senate floor. \"Children should not be forced to go hungry because a parent is incarcerated.\"\n\nPrisoners qualify for stimulus payments because of broad eligibility requirements in this relief bill — and others. Prisoners must be a citizen or legal resident, and either need to have filed a tax return, possibly as part of a joint filing, or complete an Internal Revenue Service form requesting payment.\n\nIt's worth noting that the two previous rounds of stimulus checks during the Trump administration — in the CARES Act in March, and the supplemental package in December — allowed prisoners to receive checks, too.\n\nCotton voted for both of those bills.\n\nHis press secretary James Arnold said circumstances were different. In the CARES Act, the issue was \"an unanticipated problem,\" and in December, there was no opportunity to amend the bill.\n\nThe issue had come up before.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama's economic recovery package barred stimulus checks for most prisoners. Only a few thousand got them, through an exception in the law for those who had just gone to jail.\n\nIn 2020, Washington put a priority on getting checks to people as quickly as possible. The CARES Act kept the eligibility rules broad and simple. Basically, anyone who was an American citizen or permanent legal resident, wasn't claimed as a dependent by someone else, and had filed a tax return (or didn't need to because they made very little), could get a check.\n\nWith the December bill, Republicans could have added a prisoner ban to the legislation before it came to an up-or-down vote.\n\nThe issue of prisoners and stimulus checks had long been in the news. Earlier in the year, the IRS blocked CARES Act payments to prisoners. That prompted a class action lawsuit on behalf of incarcerated people, arguing that the IRS rule was arbitrary and unlawful.\n\nIn October, a federal judge ruled against the IRS and said the government had to issue the checks. The judge ruled that the CARES Act had no language restricting payments to prisoners, and the administration couldn't invent one. That only applied to the CARES Act, but the point is, Republicans had ample opportunity to grapple with the issue as the December bill was being written."}

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corp. issued a report after the 2011 outages, stating that after a cold front led to outages in 1989, the Public Utility Commission of Texas issued recommendations to improve winterization of generators.\n\nBut those recommendations were not mandatory, and eventually the same problems that befell generators in 1989 occurred again in 2011, and similar deficiencies led to outages once again in 2021.\n\nO'Rourke said warnings about the effects of climate change on Texas also have gone largely unanswered by the state government, despite the state being hit by Hurricane Harvey, droughts and winter storms.\n\n\"I think it's clear to everyone that we should be doing far better,\" O'Rourke said.\n\nReform for ERCOT a priority, Gov. Greg Abbott says\n\nAbbott has since made reform of the state electric grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, a priority in the Texas Legislature, which is now in session."}

But we're pretty sure another contributor was the fact that he had become even more of a batshit crazy lunatic than usual, to the point that he was going on TV and suggesting his political enemies were running a satanic pedophile cult.\n\nIf you blocked that out of your mind to make room for all of the other insane events that went down over the last year, here's a quick refresher. On October 15, 2020, after backing out of the second presidential debate, Trump sat down with NBC's Savannah Guthrie for a live town hall. At one point, Guthrie said, \"Let me ask you about QAnon,\" referring to the far-right, incomprehensibly insane conspiracy theory that a cabal of Democratic politicians, liberal Hollywood actors, and high-ranking government officials, who worship Satan, were running a child-sex-trafficking ring and simultaneously plotting against Trump, who was planning a day of reckoning in which thousands of members of the cult would be arrested. \"It is this theory that Democrats are a satanic pedophile ring and that you are the savior of that,\" Guthrie said. \"Now, can you just, once and for all, state that that is completely not true and disavow QAnon in its entirety?\"\n\n\"I know nothing about QAnon,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I just told you,\" Guthrie responded.\n\n\"I know very little,\" the then president insisted. \"You told me, but what you tell me doesn't necessarily make it fact. I hate to say that. I know nothing about it. I do know they are very much against pedophilia,\" he added, contradicting his claim to knowing nothing about the group and also giving the impression that they were lawyers bringing sex traffickers to justice instead of fringe lunatics. \"They fight it very hard. But I know nothing about it...I'll tell you what I do know about. I know about antifa, and I know about the radical left, and I know how violent they are and how vicious they are. And I know how they are burning down cities run by Democrats, not run by Republicans.\"\n\nX content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nUnfortunately for Trump and his Q followers, he did not end up winning the election.

Wade that still leaves many reeling, is starting a new term with justices slated to revisit the issue of LGBTQ rights.\n\nIn 303 Creative v. Elenis, the court will return to the issue of whether or not providers of custom-made goods can refuse service to LGBTQ customers on First Amendment grounds. In this case, the business owner is Lorie Smith, a website designer in Colorado who wants to opt out of providing her graphic design services for same-sex weddings despite the civil rights law in her state.\n\nJennifer Pizer, acting chief legal officer of Lambda Legal, said in an interview with the Blade, \"it's not too much to say an immeasurably huge amount is at stake\" for LGBTQ people depending on the outcome of the case.\n\n\"This contrived idea that making custom goods, or offering a custom service, somehow tacitly conveys an endorsement of the person — if that were to be accepted, that would be a profound change in the law,\" Pizer said. \"And the stakes are very high because there are no practical, obvious, principled ways to limit that kind of an exception, and if the law isn't clear in this regard, then the people who are at risk of experiencing discrimination have no security, no effective protection by having a non-discrimination laws, because at any moment, as one makes their way through the commercial marketplace, you don't know whether a particular business person is going to refuse to serve you.\"\n\nThe upcoming arguments and decision in the 303 Creative case mark a return to LGBTQ rights for the Supreme Court, which had no lawsuit to directly address the issue in its previous term, although many argued the Dobbs decision put LGBTQ rights in peril and threatened access to abortion for LGBTQ people.\n\nAnd yet, the 303 Creative case is similar to other cases the Supreme Court has previously heard on the providers of services seeking the right to deny services based on First Amendment grounds, such as Masterpiece Cakeshop and Fulton v. City of Philadelphia. In both of those cases, however, the court issued narrow rulings on the facts of litigation, declining to issue sweeping rulings either upholding non-discrimination principles or First Amendment exemptions.\n\nPizer, who signed one of the friend-of-the-court briefs in opposition to 303 Creative, said the case is \"similar in the goals\" of the Masterpiece Cakeshop litigation on the basis they both seek exemptions to the same non-discrimination law that governs their business, the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, or CADA, and seek \"to further the social and political argument that they should be free to refuse same-sex couples or LGBTQ people in particular.\"\n\n\"So there's the legal goal, and it connects to the social and political goals and in that sense, it's the same as Masterpiece,\" Pizer said. \"And so there are multiple problems with it again, as a legal matter, but also as a social matter, because as with the religion argument, it flows from the idea that having something to do with us is endorsing us.\"\n\nOne difference: the Masterpiece Cakeshop litigation stemmed from an act of refusal of service after owner, Jack Phillips, declined to make a custom-made wedding cake for a same-sex couple for their upcoming wedding. No act of discrimination in the past, however, is present in the 303 Creative case. The owner seeks to put on her website a disclaimer she won't provide services for same-sex weddings, signaling an intent to discriminate against same-sex couples rather than having done so."}

Andrew Cuomo exists in political limbo – not completely written off as a spent force, but sidelined as the campaign to replace him heats up.\n\nCuomo, who for a decade ran the Empire State and its Democratic Party apparatus, left his perch in August rather than face impeachment and removal from office following an inquiry by the state attorney general's office that found he sexually harassed multiple women and oversaw a toxic workplace.\n\nHis departure capped a stunning fall from the national political stardom he achieved during the nightmarish first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020. Cuomo's handling of the crisis, lauded then, has since come under withering scrutiny.\n\nOn Monday, the state assembly released a report of its own – broader in scope than the attorney general's – which concluded there was \"overwhelming evidence that the former Governor engaged in sexual harassment\" and that Cuomo and his senior staff were \"not fully transparent regarding the number of nursing home residents who died as a result of Covid-19.\" The misleading data, the investigators said, was then used by Cuomo to burnish his image in a now infamous book, which was written and promoted with the help of government staffers, that initially stood to make him about $5 million.\n\nCuomo has denied the multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, said he did not intentionally misstate the nursing home death count and insisted the book deal and publication process followed ethical norms.\n\nBut 18 months on from Democrats semi-seriously chewing over his presidential prospects, Cuomo is now the subject of a criminal complaint in connection to one of the harassment allegations and grand plans for an easy election to a fourth term in office – one more than his father, the late former Gov. Mario Cuomo – have been replaced by a grittier calculus.\n\nAnimating Cuomo's refusal to recede into retirement, or at least lay low in the aftermath of his resignation – which was ultimately prompted by a state legislature that was poised to impeach, convict and remove him from office – are twin struggles: to clear his name and, at the same time, make sure that New Yorkers do not forget it.\n\n'I don't know that he is powerful, but I think he is feared'\n\nToday, Cuomo's public voice is mostly limited to his email list and Twitter account, a running feed of broadsides by his lawyer, Rita Glavin, and spokesman Rich Azzopardi against the investigation overseen by New York Attorney General Letitia James into Cuomo's alleged sexual misconduct. Cuomo frequently retweets sympathetic opinion articles, including a Newsday op-ed from September that described his downfall as an \"Albany coup d'état.\" There's also a picture of the former governor and his dog, Captain, on a boat.\n\nFor many in New York politics, from operatives to lawmakers, Cuomo's swapping of the executive chamber for an online echo chamber has been a welcome one – and created a new dynamic they are keen to maintain."}

You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.\"\n\nHis supporters listened. Thousands of Trump supporters, waving Trump or Confederate flags and wearing MAGA gear, descended upon the Capitol. They overwhelmed law enforcement, pushed past police barricades, and temporarily stopped Congress from counting electoral votes.\n\nTrump's supporters had gathered earlier in the day for the \"Save America\" rally organized by a group called \"Women for America First.\" Trump allies, including former campaign staffers, helped promote the event, ABC News reported. Trump's White House schedule showed he was to speak at the rally that day.\n\nSome of Trump's fiercest allies also made incendiary statements at the rally. \"Let's have trial by combat,\" said Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, warming up the crowd for Trump.\n\nWe looked closely at the words Trump used to urge his supporters to show up and \"fight\" on his behalf Jan. 6. With Trump's Twitter account permanently suspended, we used archives of his tweets by Factba.se and the Trump Twitter archive.\n\nWe contacted spokespersons for Trump and did not get a response.\n\nWhat Trump said before Jan. 6\n\nFor months before Election Day, Trump repeatedly told his supporters falsehoods about voting, including that Democrats had \"rigged\" the election. Trump ramped up the rhetoric after he lost the election, filing court challenges in battleground states trying to get judges to reverse the outcome. After he racked up defeats in court, Trump's tactics turned toward ordering senators to \"fight\" for him.\n\n\".@senatemajldr and Republican Senators have to get tougher, or you won't have a Republican Party anymore. We won the Presidential Election, by a lot. FIGHT FOR IT. Don't let them take it away!\" he tweeted Dec. 18.\n\nIn December, Trump also issued a battle cry to his supporters broadly, encouraging them to gather on his behalf Jan. 6.\n\nDec. 12: On the day of pro-Trump rallies in Washington, D.C., Trump tweeted \"Wow! Thousands of people forming in Washington (D.C.) for Stop the Steal. Didn't know about this, but I'll be seeing them! #MAGA.\"\n\nDec. 12: \"WE HAVE JUST BEGUN TO FIGHT!!!\" Trump said in another tweet.\n\nDec. 19: Trump tweeted his praise for a report by his adviser Peter Navarro alleging election fraud: \"A great report by Peter. Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election. Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\"\n\nDec. 26: Trump tweeted: \"The 'Justice' Department and the FBI have done nothing about the 2020 Presidential Election Voter Fraud, the biggest SCAM in our nation's history, despite overwhelming evidence. They should be ashamed. History will remember. Never give up. See everyone in D.C. on January 6th.\"\n\nDec. 27: \"See you in Washington, DC, on January 6th. Don't miss it. Information to follow!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nJan. 1: \"The BIG Protest Rally in Washington, D.C., will take place at 11.00 A.M. on January 6th. Locational details to follow. StopTheSteal!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nJan. 1: \"January 6th. See you in D.C.\" Trump tweeted.\n\nJan. 3: Trump retweeted @JenLawrence21, an organizer of a March for Trump bus tour: \"Now we will bring it to DC on Jan 6 and PROUDLY stand beside you!\"\n\nJan. 3: Trump retweeted Amy Kremer, another promoter of the march who said, \"We are excited to announce the site of our January 6th event will be The Ellipse in the President's Park, just steps from the White House!\"\n\nJan. 3: Trump retweeted @CodeMonkeyZ: \"If you are planning to attend peaceful protests in DC on the 6th, i recommend wearing a body camera. The more video angles of that day the better.\"\n\nJan. 4: At a rally in Georgia the day before the Senate runoffs, Trump repeated his grievances about his own election. He spoke about a continued fight, both for himself and the Senate.\n\n\"If the liberal Democrats take the Senate and the White House — and they're not taking this White House — we're going to fight like hell, I'll tell you right now,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We're going to take it back,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat Trump said before the riot\n\nTrump's final direction to supporters came during his \"Save America\" rally around noon Jan. 6, when he repeated his Pants on Fire claim that he won.\n\n\"Our country has had enough,\" Trump told his supporters. \"We will not take it anymore and that's what this is all about. To use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with, we will stop the steal.\"\n\nThe crowd later chanted: \"Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump!\" Trump thanked them.\n\nTrump praised the crowd for traveling from across the nation and for \"the extraordinary love.\"\n\n\"We're gathered together in the heart of our nation's capital for one very, very basic and simple reason: to save our democracy,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump repeatedly said there was a need to \"fight.\" After he bashed \"weak\" Republicans and Biden, he said: \"Unbelievable, what we have to go through, what we have to go through and you have to get your people to fight. If they don't fight, we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don't fight. You primary them. We're going to let you know who they are, I can already tell you, frankly.\"\n\nHe continued with the fighting metaphors: \"Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It's like a boxer, and we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. We're going to have to fight much harder, and Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us. And if he doesn't, that will be a sad day for our country because you're sworn to uphold our constitution. Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy.\"\n\nTrump then invited the crowd to go to the Capitol."}

When?\n\nIn summary California has been sending $600 one-time Golden State Stimulus payments to millions of low-income households. Now Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to expand the program to California's middle class. Here's a breakdown of who would get the money if the Legislature approves his plan.\n\nIf you didn't qualify for the first round of California's $600 Golden State Stimulus checks, you might have another chance.\n\nIn February, lawmakers approved Newsom's Golden State Stimulus program to send $600 payments to millions of California's lowest-income workers. Now, with California overflowing in tax revenue from its wealthiest residents and federal relief dollars, he wants to send the payments to California's middle class. This would triple the investment to $11.9 billion.\n\n\"No state, including this state, has ever rebated more direct dollars back into the pockets of taxpayers,\" Newsom said Friday while revealing his revised spending plan for the 2021-22 tax year. Ironically, his administration claims the tax rebates help California to meet a decades-old spending limit passed by anti-tax advocates.\n\nTaxpayers earning up to $75,000 in adjusted gross income will qualify for a California stimulus check if lawmakers approve Newsom's plan. In cases where two taxpayers file jointly, the threshold is $75,000 for their combined incomes. The governor says that covers 78% of California taxpayers and will benefit two in three Californians.\n\nFamilies with at least one child or other dependent will get an extra $500 boost. Families with undocumented workers who file taxes with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, will get a $1,000 boost if they have at least one dependent. Undocumented immigrants have been excluded from thousands of dollars in federal stimulus checks, and potentially tens of thousands in unemployment benefits.\n\n\"It's the right thing to do,\" Newsom said. \"When the federal government was not able to provide those supports, the state of California will step in to do what we can.\"\n\nPeople who received the first round of $600 Golden State payments wouldn't be eligible for the second, though taxpayers with dependents who received the first round of California stimulus checks will automatically be sent the $500 boost.\n\nLawmakers have until June 15 to pass a finalized budget. If Newsom's expansion is approved, the administration hopes payments could go out within a matter of weeks.\n\nHere's who would be eligible for the Golden State Stimulus check under Newsom's expansion:"}

And all but two states — Maine and South Dakota — reported that case numbers have gone up over the past two weeks.\n\n\"It is certainly no coincidence that we are looking at exactly the time that we would expect cases to be occurring after the July Fourth weekend,\" said Dr. Bill Powderly, co-director of the infectious-disease division at Washington University's School of Medicine in St. Louis.\n\nAt the same time, parts of the country are running up against deep vaccine resistance, while the highly contagious mutant version of the coronavirus that was first detected in India is accounting for an ever-larger share of infections.\n\nNationally, 55.6% of all Americans have received at least one COVID-19 shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The fourth wall-breaking shock shot would become one of the most iconic moments in cinema history, and the film was credited with launching the first hit genre: the Western. It also arguably started the love affair between Hollywood and firearms, with guns becoming as commonplace and everlasting on film sets as gaffers tape and catering.\n\nYet an Oct. 21 tragedy on the set of another Western, Rust — where Alec Baldwin accidentally shot and killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza while practicing a cross draw with a loaded gun he had been told was safe to handle — might very well change the industry's stance toward live and even less-than-live weapons.\n\n\"This can't happen again,\" declares Black Panther director of photography Rachel Morrison, the first woman nominated for an Oscar for cinematography for the 2017 film Mudbound. \"Not ever. The technology is there to do most things without live fire.\"\n\nAgreed Cassian Elwes, who produced Lee Daniels' The Butler and the upcoming New Mexico-set science-fiction movie Robots: \"The time has come to say that we shouldn't even be firing blanks on sets. Unfortunately, we live in a society where guns are part of the culture. Screenwriters use guns for excitement, effect, drama, comedy. Guns are everywhere. I hate them on set.\"\n\nProductions already were increasingly relying on airsoft prop guns (which simulate a slight kick with a plastic BB but do not use explosive gunpowder) and then decorating the footage in postproduction with CG muzzle flashes.\n\nLucifer co-showrunner Joe Henderson recalls a production meeting two years ago when the question occurred to him: Would it be easier and cheaper nowadays to use CG for gunfire given all the safety checks involved with using live weapons? He was surprised when the answer came back yes.\n\n\"It was a real eye-opener for me,\" Henderson recalls. \"Usually there's this assumption there will be live guns. The fact that it was more affordable and safer to use CG made it a no-brainer to change, but it's just one of those things you never think to look at. I got excited because it was one less risk and seemed like a win-win.\"\n\nFollowing the Rust tragedy, more shows are following suit. ABC's The Rookie showrunner Alexi Hawley announced Oct. 22 that the production no longer would use quarter- or half-load blanks while filming the Nathan Fillion drama. \"There will be no more 'live' weapons on the show,\" Hawley wrote. \"The safety of our cast and crew is too important. Any risk is too much risk.\"\n\nAnd a proposed new law might take the decision out of the hands of filmmakers — at least in California. Democratic State Sen. Dave Cortese issued a statement Oct. 23 saying that he plans to introduce legislation banning live ammunition and firearms from movie sets and theatrical productions. \"There is an urgent need to address alarming work abuses and safety violations occurring on the set of theatrical productions, including unnecessary high-risk conditions such as the use of live firearms,\" Cortese wrote. \"Our entertainment industry must do a better job of ensuring safe working conditions for our hardworking crews.\""}

I want to talk to you about where we are in the battle against COVID-19, the progress we've made, and the work we have left to do.\n\nAnd it starts with understanding this: Even as the Delta variant 19 [sic] has — COVID-19 — has been hitting this country hard, we have the tools to combat the virus, if we can come together as a country and use those tools.\n\nIf we raise our vaccination rate, protect ourselves and others with masking and expanded testing, and identify people who are infected, we can and we will turn the tide on COVID-19.\n\nIt will take a lot of hard work, and it's going to take some time. Many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not vaccinated, even though the vaccine is safe, effective, and free.\n\nYou might be confused about what is true and what is false about COVID-19. So before I outline the new steps to fight COVID-19 that I'm going to be announcing tonight, let me give you some clear information about where we stand.\n\nFirst, we have cons- — we have made considerable progress\n\nin battling COVID-19. When I became President, about 2 million Americans were fully vaccinated. Today, over 175 million Americans have that protection.\n\nBefore I took office, we hadn't ordered enough vaccine for every American. Just weeks in office, we did. The week before I took office, on January 20th of this year, over 25,000 Americans died that week from COVID-19. Last week, that grim weekly toll was down 70 percent.\n\nAnd in the three months before I took office, our economy was faltering, creating just 50,000 jobs a month. We're now averaging 700,000 new jobs a month in the past three months.\n\nThis progress is real. But while America is in much better shape than it was seven months ago when I took office, I need to tell you a second fact.\n\nWe're in a tough stretch, and it could last for a while. The highly contagious Delta variant that I began to warn America about back in July spread in late summer like it did in other countries before us.\n\nWhile the vaccines provide strong protections for the vaccinated, we read about, we hear about, and we see the stories of hospitalized people, people on their death beds, among the unvaccinated over these past few weeks.\n\nThis is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. And it's caused by the fact that despite America having an unprecedented and successful vaccination program, despite the fact that for almost five months free vaccines have been available in 80,000 different locations, we still have nearly 80 million Americans who have failed to get the shot.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, there are elected officials actively working to undermine the fight against COVID-19. Instead of encouraging people to get vaccinated and mask up, they're ordering mobile morgues for the unvaccinated dying from COVID in their communities. This is totally unacceptable."}

Then, taking his place in the White House Oval Office, he plunged into a stack of executive actions that began to undo the heart of his polarizing predecessor 's agenda on matters from the deadly pandemic to climate change.\n\nAt the Capitol, with America's tradition of peaceful transfers of power never appearing more fragile, the ceremony unfolded within a circle of security forces evocative of a war zone and devoid of crowds because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nInstead, Biden gazed out on a cold Washington morning dotted with snow flurries to see over 200,000 American flags planted on the National Mall to symbolize those who could not attend in person.\n\n\"The will of the people has been heard, and the will of the people has been heeded.

The new president denounced \"lies told for power and for profit\" and was blunt about the challenges ahead.\n\nCentral among them: the surging virus that has claimed more than 400,000 lives in the United States, as well as economic strains and a national reckoning over race.\n\n\"We have much to do in this winter of peril, and significant possibilities. Much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build and much to gain,\" Biden said. \"Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged, or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now.\"\n\nBiden was eager to go big early, with an ambitious first 100 days including a push to speed up the distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations to anxious Americans and pass a $1.9 trillion economic relief package. It included a blitz of executive orders on matters that don't require congressional approval — a mix of substantive and symbolic steps to unwind the Trump years. His actions included re-entry into the Paris Climate Accords and a mandate for wearing masks on federal property.\n\n\"There's no time to start like today,\" a masked Biden said. in the Oval Office. Then he swore in hundreds of aides — virtually — telling them, \"You're my possibilities.\"\n\nThe absence of Biden's predecessor from the inaugural ceremony underscored the national rift to be healed.\n\nBut a bipartisan trio of former presidents — Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama — were there to witness the transfer of power. Trump, awaiting his second impeachment trial, was at his Florida resort by the time the swearing-in took place."}

Others are anonymous role players whose contributions went mostly unnoticed by outsiders.\n\nThere are veterans who joined up for one final run at the title, and wide-eyed rookies who were thrust into the Super Bowl spotlight.\n\nTheir first names range from A to Z with eight guys named Brandon — a ninth named Brandin — and five guys named Kyle.\n\nThey all are part of the Brady Bunch, the 218 players who have appeared in a Super Bowl as Tom Brady's teammate in his record nine previous trips to the title game with New England. That list will grow by more than 40 names next Sunday when Brady plays in his 10th Super Bowl and first with his new team in Tampa.\n\nOf those players who have been part of Brady's supporting cast, 164 got a Super Bowl ring out of the trip, accounting for nearly one-quarter of the players who were on a winning team in the Super Bowl since Brady became a starter in 2001.\n\nSome went along for the ride and barely made an impact on those six titles Brady won. Others delivered the key plays that decided those games, whether it was Malcolm Butler's game-sealing interception at the goal line against Seattle, or Adam Vinatieri's inning kicks against St. Louis and Carolina.\n\nHere's a look at some of them:\n\nMost appearances\n\nNo one has played in more Super Bowls with Brady than Stephen Gostkowski, who went with him six times during their tenures in New England. Rob Gronkowski can join a group right behind Gostkowski this year with his fifth appearance, matching the number for Matt Light, Devin McCourty, Patrick Chung and Matthew Slater.\n\nThere are 26 players who have played in three Super Bowl wins as Brady's teammates, with Gronkowski hoping to join that group this year. Gronkowski played in Super Bowl wins following the 2014 and '18 seasons but missed the epic comeback against Atlanta following the 2016 season with an injury.\n\nHall of Famers\n\nThree of Brady's Super Bowl teammates have already been inducted into the Hall of Fame with more likely to come down the road. Ty Law, who played on the first three title teams in New England, was inducted to the Canton, Ohio shrine in 2019 and is the only one of the three to get there based mostly on their careers with Brady.\n\nRandy Moss and Junior Seau joined up with Brady late in their careers and both made big impacts during the perfect 16-0 regular season in 2007, but came up short in their only trip to the Super Bowl.\n\nRichard Seymour is a Hall of Fame finalist this year and others such as Gronkowski, Vinatieri and Darrelle Revis could follow in upcoming years.\n\nLeading men\n\nBrady has completed passes to 37 players in his nine previous Super Bowl trips, with a few standing out as his favorite targets. Julian Edelman and Deion Branch, who both won Super Bowl MVPs with Brady, are tied for the most catches with 24 apiece. Edelman's 337 yards are 16 more than Branch for the most of any of Brady's targets.\n\nGronkowski could pass them this year as he comes into the game with 23 catches for 297 yards. He already has the most TD catches from Brady with three, one ahead of David Givens, Danny Amendola and linebacker Mike Vrabel.\n\nGostkowski has the most points scored alongside Brady with 33, but two other players have more significant scores. James White scored 20 of his 26 career Super Bowl points in the comeback win over Atlanta four years ago, including the TD that helped force overtime and the OT winner.\n\nVinatieri is next with 20, including the field goals that won the title in Brady's first two trips."}

Baldwin discharged the gun, fatally striking 42-year-old cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuring 48-year-old director Joel Souza. No charges have been brought but the sheriff's office's investigation is ongoing.\n\nSources on the Rust set have insisted the fatal accident was a result of failings from top to bottom, starting with the production's low-budget and cost-cutting measures.\n\nGutierrez-Reed was described as being \"inexperienced and green\" by a Rust production source, who told The Daily Beast there were at least two previous incidents of guns being accidentally discharged by other crew members before Thursday's tragic incident.\n\nAccording to the Actors' Equity Association's guidelines, guns should be test-fired off stage before each use. \"All loading of firearms must be done by the property master, armorer or experienced persons working under their direct supervision,\" the association advises.\n\nTwo Rust production sources, who have both worked in the industry for decades, claim that assistant director Dave Halls, who is named in the search warrant affidavit as the person who handed the gun to Baldwin and said it was safe, should have also checked the weapons.\n\n\"He's supposed to be our last line of defense and he failed us,\" the first source said. \"He's the last person that's supposed to look at that firearm.\"\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Gutierrez-Reed had placed three prop guns on a cart outside where the scene was being filmed, before Halls grabbed a revolver from the cart and gave it to Baldwin. Halls called out \"cold gun!\" on set, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe second production source told The Daily Beast that the first assistant director should be personally verifying whether a weapon is \"hot\" or \"cold.\" (A \"cold gun\" indicates there are no cartridges—including blanks—inside the firearm. A \"hot gun\" indicates the weapon is loaded with cartridges, either live ammunition or blank rounds.) \"This check alone should've prevented this incident,\" the person said.\n\nIn a heartbreaking 911 call, script supervisor Mamie Mitchell also seemed to reference Halls as she urgently asked a dispatcher to send an ambulance to the set at Bonanza Creek Ranch, on the outskirts of Santa Fe."}

Oil prices slumped below $60 a barrel on Tuesday and have tumbled more than 12% in less than two weeks on a series of factors including softening physical demand and the unwinding of long positions.

Despite the decline, crude is still up almost 20% this year, and as Covid-19 vaccinations accelerate worldwide, there is confidence greater mobility will boost fuel consumption in the longer term.\n\n\"Oil's had a deep correction because of near-term demand, but the outlook that consumption will improve remains valid in the longer term,\" said Will Sungchil Yun, a senior commodities analyst at VI Investment Corp. in Seoul.

Even during and after the election when Trump made claims of voter fraud, they labeled his posts rather than remove them.\n\nAnti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt blamed Trump for Wednesday's deadly events but also said the responsibility rested on the shoulders of the major tech companies.\n\n\"It's long overdue for Silicon Valley to step up and not just to temporarily take Trump off their platforms but to ban him permanently. He has used their products to incite an act of domestic terror in the heart of our government, in the temple of our democracy. This is a federal crime,\" Greenblatt told USA TODAY.\n\nHe said the companies were feeling the pressure.\n\n\"Freedom of expression is not the freedom to incite violence. That is not protected speech in any public place,\" Greenblatt said. \"And these are private businesses who can choose what customers they serve and don't serve.\"\n\nRep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, also called for permanent bans of Trump's accounts and said \"nothing short of that will meet this moment.\"\n\n\"For four years, Facebook and Twitter have given the President a platform to spew dangerous, violent lies and cause untold harm to our democracy.

Pelosi, D-Calif., asked retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré to lead an immediate review of the Capitol's security process.\n\nIn her letter Monday, Pelosi said, \"It is clear from his findings and from the impeachment trial that we must get to the truth of how this happened.\"\n\nShe added, \"As we prepare for the Commission, it is also clear from General Honoré's interim reporting that we must put forth a supplemental appropriation to provide for the safety of Members and the security of the Capitol.\"\n\nLawmakers from both parties, speaking on Sunday's news shows, signaled that even more inquiries were likely. The Senate verdict Saturday, with its 57-43 majority falling 10 votes short of the two-thirds needed to convict Trump, hardly put to rest the debate about the Republican former president's culpability for the Jan. 6 assault.\n\n\"There should be a complete investigation about what happened,\" said Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, one of seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump. \"What was known, who knew it and when they knew, all that, because that builds the basis so this never happens again.\"\n\nCassidy said he was \"attempting to hold President Trump accountable,\" and added that as Americans hear all the facts, \"more folks will move to where I was.\" He was censured by his state's party after the vote.\n\nAn independent commission along the lines of the one that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks would probably require legislation to create. That would elevate the investigation a step higher, offering a definitive government-backed accounting of events. Still, such a panel would pose risks of sharpening partisan divisions or overshadowing President Joe Biden's legislative agenda.\n\n\"There's still more evidence that the American people need and deserve to hear and a 9/11 commission is a way to make sure that we secure the Capitol going forward,\" said Sen.

The authorization also requires that individuals either have:\n\nmoderate to severely compromised immune systems due to a medical condition or due to taking immunosuppressive medications or treatments and may not mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination (examples of such medical conditions or treatments can be found in the fact sheet for health care providers) or;\n\na history of severe adverse reactions to a COVID-19 vaccine and/or component(s) of those vaccines, therefore vaccination with an available COVID-19 vaccine, according to the approved or authorized schedule, is not recommended.\n\n\"Vaccines have proven to be the best defense available against COVID-19. However, there are certain immune compromised individuals who may not mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination, or those who have a history of severe adverse reactions to a COVID-19 vaccine and therefore cannot receive one and need an alternative prevention option,\" said Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"Today's action authorizes the use of the combination of two monoclonal antibodies to reduce the risk of developing COVID-19 in these individuals.\"\n\nOne dose of Evusheld, administered as two separate consecutive intramuscular injections (one injection per monoclonal antibody, given in immediate succession), may be effective for pre-exposure prevention for six months. Evusheld is not authorized for individuals for the treatment of COVID-19 or for post-exposure prevention of COVID-19. Patients should talk with their health care provider to determine whether Evusheld is an appropriate pre-exposure prevention option for them.\n\nPre-exposure prevention with Evusheld is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended. The FDA has approved one vaccine and authorized others to prevent COVID-19 and serious clinical outcomes associated with a COVID-19 infection, including hospitalization and death. The FDA urges the public to get vaccinated if eligible. Learn more about FDA-approved or -authorized COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system's ability to fight off harmful pathogens such as viruses. Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are long-acting monoclonal antibodies that are specifically directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, designed to block the virus' attachment and entry into human cells. Tixagevimab and cilgavimab bind to different, non-overlapping sites on the spike protein of the virus.\n\nThe issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval. In determining whether to issue an EUA, the FDA evaluates the totality of available scientific evidence and carefully balances any known or potential risks with any known or potential benefits of the product. Based on the FDA's review of the totality of the scientific evidence available, the agency has determined that it is reasonable to believe that Evusheld may be effective for use as pre-exposure prevention in certain adults and pediatric individuals (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms). The agency has also determined that the known and potential benefits of Evusheld, when used consistent with the terms and conditions of the authorization, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product. There are no adequate, approved and available alternatives to Evusheld for the pre-exposure prevention of COVID-19 in the authorized population."}

As services are being restored, questions are being asked about what caused the outage, and why it took so long to fix.\n\nWhy did Facebook go down?\n\nJust before 5pm UTC, people began noticing they could not access Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger. It would be more than five hours before services would begin to be restored.\n\nFacebook issued a statement on Tuesday confirming that the cause of the outage was a configuration change to the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between the company's data centres, which had a cascading effect, bringing all Facebook services to a halt.\n\nIt meant not only was Facebook gone, but everything Facebook runs disappeared too.\n\nOthers have provided a bit more detail on why Facebook vanished from the internet.\n\nCloudflare – which had its own recent internet outage issues – has provided a detailed explanation about what happened.\n\nIt involves two things that sort out how the internet is the internet – that is Domain Name System (DNS) and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).\n\nThe internet is a lot of connected networks. A lot. So that means to keep order of things, you need something like BGP to tell you where you need to go. DNS is essentially the address system for the location of each website – its IP address – while BGP is the roadmap that finds the most efficient way to get to that IP address.\n\nCloudflare said Facebook on Monday essentially told BGP through a series of updates that those paths to Facebook no longer existed. But not just for Facebook, everything Facebook runs. That meant people trying to reach Facebook couldn't find the path to access it.\n\nWhy were Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp down?\n\nAll of Facebook's services were affected, not just Facebook. It included Facebook's own internal systems, with reports staff were locked out of offices, and could not access their own internal communications platform.\n\nWhy did it take so long to fix?\n\nFacebook's own internal systems are run from the same place so it was hard for employees to diagnose and resolve the problem.\n\nAs the Guardian's UK technology editor, Alex Hern, put it on Twitter, \"Facebook runs EVERYTHING through Facebook\", so the usual way you would fix a problem like this was also not working.\n\nFacebook staff were reportedly unable to access their own communications platform, Workplace, and were unable to access their office due to the security pass system being caught up in the outage.\n\nFacebook indicated the duration and severity of the outage meant the systems were being brought back to full capacity slowly.\n\nHow did they eventually fix it?\n\nFacebook so far has not gone into much detail about what went wrong and how it was fixed, but there were multiple reports the social media giant sent a technical team out to its servers in California to manually reset the servers where the problem originated.\n\nCan this sort of outage be avoided in future?\n\nThis one is fairly uncommon but not something that can be completely avoided. However, the Facebook outage, along with others including the Cloudflare outage in 2020, and the Fastly one in June, show the problems with having a single point of failure for a vast number of online services people rely on.\n\nPeople rely on Facebook not only to connect with friends and family, but businesses use it to log into other services including online sales websites. In some countries, it is the dominant means of communication through services like WhatsApp. That an outage can have such a profound impact on billions of people for several hours will give some pause for thought.\n\nWas my personal data at risk?\n\nNo more than when Facebook is up and running.\n\nIsn't this all weird timing for Facebook?"}

He led the \"most successful SEAL operation in the Mekong Delta\" during the war, and subsequently had a bounty placed on him by the North Vietnamese Army due to his campaign.\n\nLater, during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, Marcinko was one of two Navy representatives for a task force known as the Terrorist Action Team (TAT).\n\nThe task force's assignment was to free the dozens of American hostages kept inside the U.S. embassy in Tehran, but their mission, Operation Eagle Claw, resulted in the deaths of eight military members after they encountered a violent storm in the desert, according to the U.S. Army Airborne and Special Operations Museum.\n\nAfter the mission's failure, Marcinko was given the responsibility of forming a full-time dedicated counter-terrorist unit.\n\nMarcinko became the first commanding officer of the team, which he named \"SEAL Team 6.\" Though the Navy only had two other SEAL units at the time, the purpose of the name was to trick other countries into believing the U.S. had three other unknown SEAL teams, the National Navy UDT SEAL Museum said.\n\nSEAL Team 6 would famously lead the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan on May 2, 2011, resulting in the death of the Saudi Arabian terrorist behind the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001.\n\nAfter his retirement in 1989, Marcinko became a best-selling author, co-writing books such as Rogue Warrior and Rogue Warrior: Green Team.\n\n\"The SEALs who knew Dick Marcinko will remember him as imaginative and bold, a warrior at heart,\" retired Navy SEAL Adm. Eric Olson told the Navy Times. \"He was a spirited rogue for sure, but we are better off for his unconventional service.\""}

When something like this happens you have two choices: Tears and laughter,\" the 61-year-old actor who played Bo Duke on the original series wrote Monday. \"I choose laughter. So... What's your caption? Here's mine: 'Miss Ida stopped by to see the General at Miss Shirley's last night...\"'\n\nOthers might caption the photo a bit differently. The 1969 orange Dodge Charger has been an increasingly controversial pop culture icon over the years, given it was named after Civil War general Robert E. Lee and was decorated with a confederate flag on its roof. In 2015, TV Land removed reruns of the show and Warner Bros. halted production of General Lee toy cars amid a movement to remove Confederate symbols across the South.\n\nSchneider defended the vehicle in a Hollywood Reporter interview last year. \"I have never had an African American come up to me and have any problem with it whatsoever,\" Schneider said. \"Dukes of Hazzard was a unifying force. Mom, grandma, everyone wanted to watch it together. But who benefits from division? The Dukes of Hazzard has been shot down, I believe unfairly. We haven't missed a generation yet, but we may miss this next one.\"\n\nSchneider noted he was returning from Tennessee, where he was working on hurricane relief efforts. \"I'll get a real look at the damage to mom's house in the morning and then head back to TN to continue flood relief,\" he added on Twitter on Tuesday. \"My request is that if you know somebody that's going through something like this, then you help them — go out and help them...\"\n\nThe actor requested help for the damages by directing fans to his studio's website. Help with hurricane relief efforts can also be more broadly donated to the United Way of Southeast Louisiana or the Red Cross."}

That's exactly what Suez Canal officials are doing in the aftermath of the giant container ship that blocked the international shipping lane for six days.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Egypt \"plans to widen and deepen the southern part of the Suez Canal where a hulking vessel ran aground and closed off the crucial waterway in March.\" Business Insider reported that, \"In a televised address on Tuesday the head of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), Osama Rabie, said an 18.6 mile stretch of the waterway would be widened by about 131 feet (40 meters) and deepened by 32 feet (10 meters) to improve the movement of ships in the area.\"\n\nA Top Priority\n\nWhen companies and organizations have recovered from a crisis, one of the first things they should do is to carefully review the cause of the crisis, then implement reforms or changes to help ensure the same situation is not repeated.\n\nStarbucks apparently did the right thing in 2018 in the wake of a headline-making crisis. The manager of one of their cafes in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania had two black men arrested who were waiting for a colleague. A few weeks later, the company closed 8,000 restaurants in the U.S. for a day so that 175,000 employees could receive anti-bias training.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service has been criticized over the years for the handling of their own crisis situations.\n\nIn a story yesterday on CBS's Sunday Morning, correspondent Jim Axelrod reported on the publication of Zero Fail: The Rise and Fall of the Secret Service. The book by Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporter Carol Leonnig is critical of the agency and how it has responded to its crises.\n\nIn response to a request for comment for this story, the agency said, \"The U.S. Secret Service is aware of an upcoming book which re-hashes past challenges the agency overcame and evolved from. Now and throughout its 156 year history, the agency's skilled workforce is dedicated to the successful execution of its critical protective and investigative missions.\"\n\nAmong those interviewed in the CBS story was former Agent Jonathan Wackrow, who was with the Secret Service for 14 years where he served on the details protecting President and Mrs. Obama. Axelrod said Wackrow's experience, \"... gives him insight into another problem plaguing the Secret Service that more money can't address: a culture lacking transparency and accountability.\"\n\nAccording to a transcript of the story, \"On November 11, 2011, a man fired a rifle at the White House, striking the building seven times. The Obamas weren't home, but their daughters were. Despite agents reporting gunfire, Leonnig writes they were told by superiors to stand down. Secret Service leadership initially told no one – not their agents, not the public, not even President and Mrs. Obama.\n\n\"Thankfully, [it] didn't have a tragic outcome. But afterwards? Nothing,\" said Wackrow. \"There was no, 'Hey, let's get everybody together and let's review what happened.'\"\n\n\"Axelrod asked, \"But how could there not be?\"\n\n\"The Secret Service is the best organization in the world in crisis management. Yet, they can't manage themselves,\" Wackrow replied. \"It was an embarrassment, but you have to learn from it.\"\n\nSecret Service Responds\n\nIn response to a request to comment on the CBS story, the Secret Service provided a link to a report by the National Academy of Public Administration. The agency said in a statement that, \"The Academy Panel determined that the U.S. Secret Service has taken significant, wide-ranging, and important actions.\"\n\nSubstantial Changes Made\n\n\"Specifically, the agency has made a substantial number of organizational, policy, and process changes to transform the way it does business; professionalize administrative, technical, and management functions; and address numerous staffing and employee issues. Agency leadership has made these changes in a relatively short time, demonstrating a strong commitment to change.\""}

As long as this pandemic is raging anywhere in the world, the American people will still be vulnerable. And the United States is committed to bringing the same urgency to international vaccination efforts that we have demonstrated at home.\n\nAlready the United States has committed $4 billion to support COVAX, and we have launched partnerships to boost global capacity to manufacture more vaccines. My administration supports efforts to temporarily waive intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines because, over time, we need more companies producing life-saving doses of proven vaccines that are shared equitably. We have already shared more than 4 million doses of vaccine with Canada and Mexico, and last month, I announced that, by the end of June, the United States will share 80 million doses of our vaccine supply with the world.\n\nToday, we're providing more detail on how we will allocate the first 25 million of those vaccines to lay the ground for increased global coverage and to address real and potential surges, high burdens of disease, and the needs of the most vulnerable countries. At least 75 percent of these doses—nearly 19 million—will be shared through COVAX, including approximately 6 million doses for Latin America and the Caribbean, approximately 7 million for South and Southeast Asia, and approximately 5 million for Africa, working in coordination with the African Union and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. The remaining doses, just over 6 million, will be shared directly with countries experiencing surges, those in crisis, and other partners and neighbors, including Canada, Mexico, India, and the Republic of Korea.\n\nWe are sharing these doses not to secure favors or extract concessions. We are sharing these vaccines to save lives and to lead the world in bringing an end to the pandemic, with the power of our example and with our values. And we will continue to follow the science and to work in close cooperation with our democratic partners to coordinate a multilateral effort, including through the G7."}

In fact, some fans waited for more than an hour behind 5,000-6,000 others to order seats.\n\nThe highest increase, however, reflects the elimination of about 3,000 seats in the 300 level which used to be offered at half price to youths.\n\n\"2020 was a magical season for our fans and organization that started with the arrival of Tom Brady along with Rob Gronkowski and many other top free agents and concluded with a history-making win in Super Bowl 55 at home in Raymond James Stadium,\" said Bucs Chief Operating Officer Brian Ford.\n\n\"Over the past few seasons, we have invested more than $150 million in stadium renovations at Raymond James Stadium to ensure that it remains one of the country's premier NFL stadiums.

Under this model, it partnered with affiliates who launched the attacks. The affiliates received 75% to 90% of the ransom, with DarkSide keeping the remainder.\n\nSince 2019, numerous gangs have ratcheted up pressure with a technique known as \"double extortion.\" Upon entering a system, they steal sensitive data before launching ransomware that encodes the files and makes it impossible for hospitals, universities, and cities to do their daily work. If the loss of computer access is not sufficiently intimidating, they threaten to reveal confidential information, often posting samples as leverage. For instance, when the Washington, DC, police department didn't pay the $4 million ransom demanded by a gang called Babuk last month, Babuk published intelligence briefings, names of criminal suspects and witnesses, and personnel files, from medical information to polygraph test results, of officers and job candidates.\n\nDarkSide, which emerged last August, epitomized this new breed. It chose targets based on a careful financial analysis or information gleaned from corporate emails. For instance, it attacked one of Tantleff's clients during a week when the hackers knew the company would be vulnerable because it was transitioning its files to the cloud and didn't have clean backups.\n\nTo infiltrate target networks, the gang used advanced methods such as \"zero-day exploits\" that immediately take advantage of software vulnerabilities before they can be patched. Once inside, it moved swiftly, looking not only for sensitive data but also for the victim's cyber insurance policy, so it could peg its demands to the amount of coverage. After two to three days of poking around, DarkSide encrypted the files.\n\n\"They have a faster attack window,\" said Christopher Ballod, associate managing director for cyber risk at Kroll, the business investigations firm, who has advised half a dozen DarkSide victims. \"The longer you dwell in the system, the more likely you are to be caught.\"\n\nTypically, DarkSide's demands were \"on the high end of the scale,\" $5 million and up, Ballod said. One scary tactic: if publicly traded companies didn't pay the ransom, DarkSide threatened to share information stolen from them with short-sellers who would profit if the share price dropped upon publication.\n\nDarkSide's site on the dark web identified dozens of victims and described the confidential data it claimed to have filched from them. One was New Orleans law firm Stone Pigman Walther Wittmann. \"A big annoyance is what it was,\" attorney Phil Wittmann said, referring to the DarkSide attack in February. \"We paid them nothing,\" said Michael Walshe Jr., chair of the firm's management committee, declining to comment further.\n\nLast November, DarkSide adopted what is known as a \"ransomware-as-a-service\" model. Under this model, it partnered with affiliates who launched the attacks. The affiliates received 75% to 90% of the ransom, with DarkSide keeping the remainder. As this partnership suggests, the ransomware ecosystem is a distorted mirror of corporate culture, with everything from job interviews to procedures for handling disputes. After DarkSide shut down, several people who identified themselves as its affiliates complained on a dispute resolution forum that it had stiffed them. \"The target paid, but I did not receive my share,\" one wrote.\n\nTogether, DarkSide and its affiliates reportedly grossed at least $90 million. Seven of Tantleff's clients, including two companies in the energy industry, paid ransoms ranging from $1.25 million to $6 million, reflecting negotiated discounts from initial demands of $7.5 million to $30 million. His other three clients hit by DarkSide did not pay. In one of those cases, the hackers demanded $50 million. Negotiations grew acrimonious, and the two sides couldn't agree on a price."}

Throughout our history, our nations have worked together, have stood together to make our world a safer and stronger world.\n\nMr. Prime Minister, when you and I last spoke in June, we talked about how our world is more interconnected and interdependent than ever before. And the challenges that we face today have highlighted that fact — be it COVID-19, the climate crisis, and the importance of our shared belief in a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\n\nOn COVID-19, our nations have worked together.

Facebook (FB) had blocked Trump's accounts \"indefinitely\" a day earlier, a suspension that was upheld in May by the company's court-like Oversight Board and is up for review again in November. Google-owned YouTube announced a suspension of Trump's channel a week later but has left the door open for him to return to the platform.\n\nTwitter's decision to remove Trump didn't happen immediately. The platform initially banned Trump for 12 hours on January 6. Twitter took heat when it let him back on and he quickly tweeted again, calling his followers who stormed the Capitol \"patriots.\" The Washington Post detailed a January 8 meeting in which Gadde made an \"impassioned appeal\" for staffers to have patience as her team deliberated what to do. Hours later, Twitter banned Trump permanently.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that Gadde played a central role in the Trump ban decision. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was reportedly vacationing on a private island at the time. (Twitter has said Dorsey was closely involved in the decision.) Asked this month about her role in banning Trump, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN Business: \"Policy enforcement decisions are made by our Trust and Safety team, which report to Vijaya Gadde.\" The spokesperson also said Twitter has \"no plans to reinstate\" Trump's account.\n\n\"Vijaya is at the crossroads of some of the most important policy decisions the company is making and how it interacts with governments around the world.\" Former Twitter COO Adam Bain"}

Should we find it is failing to honour its commitments, we will not hesitate to take further action.\"\n\nFacebook said it would suspend or ban users who \"repeatedly\" create groups dedicated to fake reviews, and introduce new technology to flag such groups automatically and make it harder for people to find and join the groups in the first place.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said: \"We have engaged extensively with the CMA to address this issue. Fraudulent and deceptive activity is not allowed on our platforms, including offering or trading fake reviews. Our safety and security teams are continually working to help prevent these practices.\"\n\nThe scourge of fake reviews has spread across much of the internet. In October 2018, an investigation by Which? found that Facebook \"factories\" were producing the reviews, which were then almost entirely posted on Amazon. The e-commerce site would prioritise reviews from \"genuine\" buyers, who were then reimbursed for their trouble by the scammers on Facebook. The expensive \"genuine\" reviews were then backed up by tens of thousands of unverified positive reviews.\n\nAnother investigation looked at products on Amazon and found that 71% of headphones had perfect five-star ratings – but that the text of the reviews often referred to unrelated products such as soap dispensers. One set of headphones made by the brand Celebrat had 439 reviews. All were five-star, all unverified, and all arrived on the same day."}

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThe tech chief, Mike Schroepfer, said in a post to his own Facebook page on Wednesday that he would leave the role sometime in 2022. He will then be replaced by Andrew Bosworth, currently the leader of Facebook's augmented and virtual reality division, further signalling Facebook's push into that business. Schroepfer has been CTO since 2013. The news was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nBosworth is another early Facebook employee and member of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's inner circle who has steadily moved up through the ranks. He joined in 2006, two years before Schroepfer, and was one of the company's earlier executives with the title of vice president. Over the years, Bosworth, known as Boz, helped build central parts of the platform, including its News Feed, Messages, and Groups, before moving on to augmented and virtual reality projects.\n\n\"This is a difficult decision because of how much I love Facebook and how excited I am about the future we are building together,\" Schroepfer wrote in his post. But he is not leaving the company entirely. He said he is to become a \"senior fellow\" within Facebook next year, a first-of-its-kind role at the company, although he did not say what exactly the role will entail.\n\nZuckerberg called Schroepfer \"a close friend\" in a statement on Facebook's press site and said he had \"played a critical role in almost everything we've done.\" He added that the senior fellow position will see Schroepfer helping with recruitment and \"continuing to foster our AI investments.\"\n\nSchroepfer is among the first of Facebook's true old-guard to move away from the company, having been there for 13 years. But other executive departures have come in recent months. David Fischer, Facebook's chief revenue officer, announced his exit in spring. Then VR leader Hugo Barra left, as did advertising head Carolyn Everson, and app head Fidji Simo.\n\nNot everyone is cheering the change, however. Samidh Chakrabarti, who was previously a director of product management at Facebook, suggested on Twitter that a Facebook without Schroepfer is \"worrisome.\"\n\n\"After I left FB earlier this month, many existing employees asked me who could now best be their ally on matters of societal import,\" Chakrabarti wrote. \"Who was on my short list every single time? Schrep. So this is indeed significant.\"\n\nIn the post announcing his job change, Schroepfer said that Bosworth was responsible for the creation of Facebook's entire AR and VR organization thus far, now called Facebook Realty Labs, and led research efforts and hardware rollouts like Oculus and Portal.\n\n\"These contributions are foundational components of our broader efforts to help build the metaverse,\" Schroepfer said. Zuckerberg echoed that point, saying in his note that Bosworth's work is \"foundational to our broader efforts helping to build the metaverse, and I'm excited about the future of this work under Boz's leadership.\"\n\nZuckerberg has been a fierce advocate for Facebook's push into AR and VR, saying on an earnings call earlier this year that he wants it to be \"a metaverse company.\" The term \"metaverse\" refers to a manifestation of the social, physical world in digital space, like in the games \"Animal Crossing\" or \"Second Life\" — or, as Zuckerberg put it, \"an embodied internet that you're inside of rather than just looking at.\""}

Jamie Raskin had just buried his 25-year-old son last week when, a day later, he entered the United States Capitol with his youngest daughter to carry out his sworn duty to certify the election of President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nHours after Raskin entered the Capitol with his daughter and a son-in-law, his family faced a violent insurrection, which now marks one of the most horrific days in modern U.S. history.\n\nRaskin was named the House's lead manager in Trump's impeachment trial this week. He authored a House resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th amendment and then drafted articles of impeachment accusing President Donald Trump of \"incitement of insurrection.\"\n\nOn Jan. 20, Trump will be forced to step down and President-elect Joe Biden will take power. With the end of his term approaching, some people have questioned why Congress would pursue Trump's removal from office.\n\n\"We're trying to put every tool in the constitutional toolkit on the table,\" Raskin told ABC News' daily podcast \"Start Here.\" \"The president is a clear and present danger to the people and to the republic. So we have to use whatever levers are still available to us to remove him from office.\"\n\nRaskin said he hoped the 25th Amendment, which would remove Trump from his post and put Pence in power, would be \"a middle ground solution that everybody, people who are strongly for impeachment and people who are against impeachment, can converge upon.\"\n\nAs an alternative route, he believes impeachment will pass on Wednesday.\n\n\"I think there's overwhelming sentiment that this president cannot remain in office another single day,\" Raskin said. \"We need him out of office. He is a clear and present danger to the people of the United States right now.\"\n\nWith regard to Trump's first impeachment, Rasking said the \"Senate did not do their duty and did not convict and remove him.\" The president, he said, has continued to commit \"impeachable offenses.\""}

Please enable JavaScript for the best experience.\n\nWhen a mammoth ship became wedged in the Suez Canal, one thing was clear. The entire world needed it to move.\n\nHow the Ever Given was freed from the Suez Canal: A visual analysis\n\nThe crisis in the Suez Canal last month turned the world's attention on a single challenge few had ever considered: how to refloat a 200,000-ton mass of steel, as long as the Empire State Building is high.\n\nDigging, tugging and pulling, it turned out, freed the ship. The days-long, round-the-clock effort to move the massive vessel involved sucking sand and mud from underneath its hull, as tugboats pushed and pulled the ship in confluence with a swelling tide.\n\nHere's how it happened.\n\nYour browser does not support the video element. The Ever Given container ship became stuck at an angle in the Suez Canal during a sandstorm on March 23, blocking for six days a vital waterway through which about 15 percent of all shipping passes. Using satellite imagery and vessel data, The Post reconstructed the operation that released the ship. The canal narrows below the shoreline, which meant the ship was much more stuck than it appeared to be in photos. Riprap, or loosely placed stones, lines the banks, which made it even harder to dislodge the ship. A fleet of tugboats, dredgers and salvage crews worked for several days to refloat the ship. On Monday morning, they managed to free the stern, the back of the vessel, the most visible sign of progress since the blockage. After a morning boost from a high tide reaching nearly seven feet, a new attempt to release the Ever Given began Monday afternoon. The Ever Given was fully dislodged on Monday at 3:05 p.m. local time.\n\nThe Ever Given got stuck the morning of March 23, amid poor visibility and high winds in one of the narrower parts of the 120-mile canal. Egyptian officials have launched an investigation into the details of the crash.\n\n\"When you're traveling on a boat and you hit something, there's a tremendous sense of loss,\" said Gregory Tylawsky, a licensed shipmaster and founder of the Maritime Expert Group.\n\nEarly in the crisis, experts were unsure how they would be able to move the ship. \"It is not really possible to pull it loose,\" said Peter Berdowski, the CEO of Dutch dredging company Boskalis, which helped with the week's efforts.\n\nThe vessel, he said, was like \"an enormous beached whale.\"\n\nThe canal is dug in sand and mud, meaning a boat hitting the edge would get \"stuck in the sand rather than [getting] repelled by a hard wall,\" said Ragui Assaad, a professor at the University of Minnesota and research fellow at the Economic Research Forum in Cairo.\n\nThere is little room for error. \"As a pilot, you cannot deviate from that center line,\" Tylawsky said.\n\nWithin hours of the blockage, tugboats were on the scene, followed by dredgers, working through the week to free the Japanese-owned, Taiwanese-operated ship.\n\nDays in the making\n\nEach hour the Ever Given remained stuck on a muddy bank of the Suez Canal meant worse disruptions to international commerce. A substantial share of all shipping passes through the waterway. In the face of delays, the prices of oil and coffee began to rise, and livestock faced starvation aboard some of the hundreds of vessels left waiting indefinitely.\n\nWith a ship that size already caught in the canal's bank, there wouldn't be much for the operators to do.\n\n\"It'd be controlled chaos onboard,\" said Gary Cordes, a retired shipmaster and senior adviser at the Maritime Expert Group, who said he transited the canal nine times between the 1960s and 1980s. He said it would fall on those familiar with the landscape to come up with a plan to free the ship.\n\nAuthorities worked day and night, dredging and using tugboats to dig and pull the ship away from the banks. Salvagers dredged underneath and around the hull, pumping sediment from the bottom of the canal.\n\nThe dredgers on scene were heavy-duty. The 10th of Ramadan came to help, as did the Dutch-made Mashhour, owned and operated by the Suez Canal Authority, which was touted by the Transportation Research Board in 1996 as the \"world's largest and most powerful stationary cutter suction dredger,\" capable of sucking up \"abrasive sand with gravel, compacted sand, sticky clay and rocks.\"\n\nOften more than 10 tugboats were also leading the effort, pushing and pulling the ship in an effort to dislodge it from the bank.\n\nLoaders excavated the eastern embankment at the ship's bow. Over the weekend, those efforts removed nearly 1 million cubic feet of mud and water, officials said.\n\nIn an added effort to refloat the ship, some 9,000 tons of the Ever Given's ballast water — used to stabilize the ship — were released to help lighten the vessel, officials said.\n\nThe final moments\n\nWhile efforts throughout the week proved unsuccessful, the weekend bore promises of shifting tides. A full moon on Sunday night meant unusually high waters that could help refloat the ship. And more help was on the way: two big and powerful tugboats, the Dutch-flagged Alp Guard and the Italian-flagged Carlo Magno.\n\nThrough Sunday night into Monday afternoon, teams worked tirelessly to get enough of the sand and mud out from under the boat that it would rejoin the canal's waters, staving off a catastrophe for global trade.\n\nOn Monday afternoon around 3 p.m., the Ever Given broke free, its leviathan hull slowly creeping north to the Great Bitter Lake."}

Using a combination of surveys and qualitative research, this project tracks the dynamic nature of public opinion as vaccine development and distribution unfold, including vaccine confidence and acceptance, information needs, trusted messengers and messages, as well as the public's experiences with vaccination.\n\nKey Findings\n\nThe latest KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor finds that nearly half (48%) of parents of children ages 12-17 say their child has received at least one dose of a vaccine. With news from Pfizer that clinical trials showed their COVID-19 vaccine was safe and effective for children ages five to eleven, the Vaccine Monitor (conducted September 13-22, with the bulk of interviews concluding before Pfizer's announcement) finds that about a third of parents (34%) say they will vaccinate their 5-11 year old child \"right away\" once a vaccine is authorized for their age group.\n\nAs policymakers and school leaders across the country implement policies to help limit the spread of COVID-19 in school and keep children safe, a majority of parents (58%) say K-12 schools should require all students and staff to wear masks while at school while about a third (35%) say schools should have no mask requirements at all. Regardless of preferences, nearly seven in ten parents with a child attending in-person school (69%) say their school is requiring all students and staff to wear masks and just 28% say their school has no mask requirement. While mask requirements appear to be widespread in schools, COVID-19 testing is less common with half of parents saying their school district is not offering testing to students who are not eligible to get the vaccine.\n\nWhile two-thirds (66%) of parents with a child attending in-person school say their child's school is doing about the right amount to limit the spread of COVID-19 at school, almost one in four parents of a child attending in-person school (23%) say their child has been required to quarantine at home due to a possible COVID-19 exposure since the school year began.\n\nTrends In COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake Among Children\n\nFive months after the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine's use in children ages 12 and over, nearly half (48%) of parents of children ages 12-17 say their child has received at least one dose of a vaccine. The share of parents who say they want to \"wait and see\" before getting their 12-17 year old vaccinated has decreased to 15%, down from 23% in July. Just 4% of parents say they will only get their teenager vaccinated \"if their school requires it,\" and one in five (21%) say they will \"definitely not\" vaccinate their child, similar to the share measured in previous months.\n\nOn September 20th, Pfizer announced that clinical trials showed their COVID-19 vaccine was safe and effective for children ages five to eleven. The KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor (conducted September 13-22, with the bulk of interviews concluding before Pfizer's announcement) finds that about a third of parents (34%) say they will vaccinate their 5-11 year old child \"right away\" once a vaccine is authorized for their age group. About a third of parents (32%) say they will \"wait and see\" how the vaccine is working before having their 5-11 year old vaccinated. Notably, the share who say they definitely won't get their 5-11 year old vaccinated remains steady at one in four (24%).\n\nParents continue to be more cautious about getting their younger children vaccinated with about one in four (23%) saying they will get their child under the age of 5 vaccinated right away once a vaccine is available for that age group and about a third (35%) saying they will definitely not get their child under 5 vaccinated for COVID-19."}

However, that amount is sure to rise as it does not include classroom supplies and building systems that need to be replaced, structural repairs that must be made, and the replacement of three gymnasium floors that buckled due to flooding, officials said.\n\nThe Sept. 1 tropical storm forced some school districts surrounding Newark, including those in South Orange-Maplewood and Elizabeth, to plan for a delayed start of the school year. However, Newark, which is the state's largest district, managed to open as scheduled this Tuesday despite the damage.\n\nOfficials attributed that feat to the hard work of the district's maintenance crews, custodians, and other employees, some of whom worked around the clock after the storm struck.\n\n\"They put the district's needs above their own and those of their families and even their own homes,\" school board President Dawn Haynes said in a statement. \"They did not want to let anyone down, especially the children, and they did not.\"\n\nNew Jersey remains under a state of emergency following the severe flooding and wind damage caused by Tropical Storm Ida and several tornadoes that tore through the state, which President Joe Biden visited this week during a tour of Ida's destruction.

Now that he has been found not guilty, however, he can accept those funds.\n\n\"If someone is acquitted of those charges, as Rittenhouse was today, a fundraiser started subsequently for their legal defense and other expenses would not violate this policy,\" the GoFundMe post read. \"A fundraiser to pay lawyers, cover legal expenses or to help with ongoing living expenses for a person acquitted of those charges could remain active as long as we determine it is not in violation of any of our other terms and, for example, the purpose is clearly stated and the correct beneficiary is added to the fundraiser.\"\n\nThe implication, which has been seized upon on Twitter, is that if someone is convicted of a violent crime, then GoFundMe cannot solicit or raise funds for that person. Of course, people are often wrongly convicted, and those same people are the ones most in need of fundraising to pay exorbitant court and legal costs.\n\nIn response to the backlash, GoFundMe turned off replies to its tweet on the subject.\n\n\"We constantly evaluate and evolve our Terms of Service and consider new factors that keep emerging in today's world,\" the Medium post read. \"We care deeply about human rights and have written terms to address this — we do not allow fundraisers that support hate, violence, harassment, bullying, discrimination; or involves weaponry.\" So there's that."}

But what could have happened if he called it a career after the 2019 season?\n\nThe Saints were always going to stick with Brees if he decided to run it back. If Brees would return it was going to be in a Saints uniform or no uniform at all. And that's what ended up happening. An injury-plagued year season for Brees consisted of a torn rotator cuff, torn fascia, 11 broken ribs, and a collapsed lung, that only held him out four weeks. Brees recently said at a local golf tournament this summer that the only game he was feeling 100% healthy for was against the Detroit Lions. If Brees was healthy, there is no doubt the season could have looked a lot different, but at the end of the day, he was not.\n\nSo what could have happened if Brees stepped away and started his announcing career with NBC one season early. First off, who would have started at QB for New Orleans in 2020? A source inside the Saints building said that Tom Brady had a major interest in New Orleans if in fact Brees had retired.\n\nESPN reporter Jeff Darlington said on \"Get Up\" this Tuesday, \"I think that people still underestimate how close Tom Brady was to signing with the New Orleans Saints up until he ultimately decided on the Bucs,\" Darlington said. \"I know that that's gonna be a statement people try to question.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers since Day 1 were committed on Brady and once Brees said he was returning, Brady signed with the Buccaneers. Recently on the HBO show The Shop: Uninterrupted, Brady said \"You're sticking with that motherf–ker?\" - talking about a team choosing their current starter over him. It is unclear who that team was, but it's unlikely he was referring to New Orleans."}

Our official bilateral relationship began in 1957, but of course, there are longer — and longer-standing ties that connect the people of our nations.\n\nOver the years, many Americans have traveled to Ghana to remember the history of slavery and to honor their roots and understand their ancestry. And the African diaspora in the United States, including my home state of California, is significant, and our nation is stronger for it.\n\nWe — these two nations — share a commitment to democracy. Last December, the people of Ghana voted in a free and fair election that demonstrated your nation's commitment to democratic principles and institutions.\n\nWe share a view that all people must have a voice in their future, that our democracies are stronger when everyone participates and weaker when anyone is left out.\n\nWe also share a commitment to global health. None of us have been immune from the ravages of the pandemic. We recognize our shared responsibility to collaborate, to share resources to not only continue to address the effects of COVID-19, but to prepare for the next pandemics.\n\nAnd in that way, the United States is proud to be a member of COVAX and the African Union, and has donated more than 1.2 million doses of the Moderna vaccine to Ghana. And I'm proud to announce that we will, shortly, send more than 1.3 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nFinally, we are working together to expand our economic relationship. You and I have talked about that briefly before we came in. American companies continue to ramp up in Ghana, understanding the significance of the work that they do there to America's economy, much less to the partnership between Ghana and the United States.\n\nAnd they do this also because they have confidence in the government of Ghana and the environment, Mr. President, that you have created, which allows for some confidence in the respect and upholding of the rule of law and human rights.\n\nAnd so, with all of that, we look forward to continuing to work together on all of these issues, including in the context of the United Nations Security Council. And again, I am honored to formally welcome you to the White House."}

For me, WhatsApp is as much a verb as Google, and the platform is the engine that fuels my personal and professional lives. Sometimes, despite being thousands of miles away from my family, my WhatsApp groups seem like the rooms of my childhood house: Here is my mother in one corner, fretting over my father's cavalier attitude toward the pandemic; here is an uncle nobody likes, talking about some secret conspiracy against Islam; here are my cousins sending voice notes laced with laughter, virtually re-creating a summer sleepover; here is my grandmother, reminding me to pray.\n\nFor about five hours, as the Facebook empire—including Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp—experienced a global outage, that engine sputtered to a stop for me and billions of others. For lots of people in the U.S., the outage merely stopped them from posting food photos on Instagram and instigating mask arguments on Facebook. But it meant something else in the large swaths of the developing world. Here, WhatsApp is more than just \"social media\": It's a public utility.\n\nI first downloaded the app when I moved away for college in 2008, six years before it was acquired by Facebook, for a whopping $19 billion. At the time, it operated on a subscription model: In some countries, it cost roughly $1 to download, equivalent to the cost of a handful of international text messages. For a homesick student contemplating candy and canned beans for dinner every other night, it was a pretty good deal. Today, not only is the service entirely free, but telecom companies in many countries offer data bundles that include WhatsApp and Facebook at little or no added cost, partly made possible through a controversial Facebook initiative known as Free Basics. Texting and calling cost a lot more: Sending an SMS in 2015 was 22 times more expensive in India than in the United States; in Brazil, it was 55 times as expensive. These disparities have helped fuel WhatsApp's rise in many countries. According to one estimate, nearly 500 million Indians use the platform.\n\nEven before the outage, Facebook was facing growing scrutiny over misinformation and lawsuits accusing the company of being a monopoly. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the company has internal research suggesting that Instagram is toxic for girls' mental health. WhatsApp has lots of its own problems, but it doesn't take much squinting to see the app as perhaps the closest realization of Big Tech's proclamation of technology as a force for good in the global South."}

(WLBT) - In the past three months, the country has seen an election, an attempted insurrection at the United States Capitol, an inauguration and an impeachment.\n\nFor many congressmen and women, the last three months have also been the most consequential of their political lives, first on their vote to certify the election results and then choosing whether to vote to impeach Donald Trump for a second time.\n\nRepublican Representative Michael Guest of Mississippi's District 3 has faced both criticism and praise for his decisions in the past month. We sat down with the congressman through Zoom to ask him about those decisions, how he came to them and his thoughts on the the current controversy surrounding Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nThis conversation has been edited for both length and clarity\n\nMG: \"I think as we look over the last three months, we see that that was a period unlike any time in modern United States history. We saw a very contested presidential race, a race that was not decided on Election Night--a race that was not decided for days, almost weeks later. And there was a great deal of animosity on both sides during that race. Because of some issues with the presidential election, we saw election contests filed in court, state courts, federal courts. We saw challenges to the certification of the election in Washington, D.C. We saw on the day, of course, as everyone recalls, the riots that occurred here in Washington, D.C. We saw actually the business of the American people interrupted as protesters entered into the House chambers and then we saw a second impeachment of President Donald Trump. There have been many challenges that we have faced over the last three months, over the last year. We have also seen some events that we will never see again in our lifetime.\"\n\nMG: \"I thought that there were voter irregularities, that there was probably voter fraud. Being a former prosecutor, I have prosecuted cases of voter fraud. But we were never presented evidence to show that the voter irregularity, the voter fraud was substantial enough that the elections should be overturned. I think everyone, Republicans and Democrats, if you were to ask them, probably would tell you that there was voter fraud, that there was voter irregularity. I think that we may disagree on the scale or the scope of that, but there was never evidence presented by the President, by the administration, by his campaign team that showed me that there was enough voter fraud that the election should be overturned. Now I did vote to challenge two of the states that were brought up and I did not vote to challenge those states based on election fraud or election irregularity. I believe that the will of the legislature was violated by the court system and, in Pennsylvania, by the Secretary of State. I felt like the will of the people in those states, that should have followed their legislative laws set forth by each state, were not followed and so those were the rationales that I took in voting against certifying both of those states. Not the fact that I thought there was widespread voter fraud or widespread voter misconduct in either Arizona or Pennsylvania.\""}

And they were part of, simply, what I call the 'backbone of America.' They're the spine of America, the best the country has to offer.\"\n\nHe offered condolences from himself and his wife, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, and led a moment of silence for the victims.\n\nDirecting his message to those responsible — believed to be a branch of the Islamic State opposed to the U.S. and the Taliban — as well as \"anyone who wishes America harm,\" the president warned:\n\n\"We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command.\"\n\n\"We will not be deterred by terrorists,\" Biden said, adding, \"We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation. ... America will not be intimidated.\"\n\nThe White House subsequently said Friday morning that another 12,500 people had left the country through the airport between Thursday and Friday morning.\n\nThe U.S.-led evacuation, after initially facing widespread criticism as too slow and clumsy, expanded rapidly since mid-August, which officials have touted as an enormous logistical feat.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, shortly before Biden's speech, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. said during a press conference that the military had been bracing for an attack and was prepared for future violence — but that would not stop them from more evacuations.\n\nMcKenzie said then that a suicide bomber had struck the Abbey Gate, one of the entry points to Kabul's airport, after which Islamic State gunmen opened fire on the military and civilians.\n\nThe working assessment was the bomber, having already passed through other checkpoints en route to the airport, detonated themselves as they were being screened by American forces to enter the gate, McKenzie said.\n\nAsked how the assailants could have made it through the layers of security, McKenzie — who is head of U.S. Central Command — said, \"It was a failure somewhere.\"\n\nMcKenzie also confirmed the number of American troops killed during the press conference and said 15 others were wounded, along with civilians. The troops killed included 11 Marines and a Navy medic, according to the Associated Press."}

His 15-year-old son Ethan later posts a photo on Instagram of himself holding the semi-automatic handgun, writing: \"Just got my new beauty today. SIG SAUER 9mm.

Ethan meets with a school counselor and another staff member. He says he and his mother recently went to a shooting range and that shooting sports are a family hobby, according to Oxford Community Schools Superintendent Tim Throne.\n\nSchool personnel call his mother, leave a voicemail and email her. She does not respond. While exchanging text messages with her son, she writes: \"Lol. I'm not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught.\"\n\nThat night, Ethan Crumbley records a video in which he discusses killing students, according to sheriff's Lt. Tim Willis.\n\nTuesday, Nov. 30: A teacher finds a note on Ethan's desk that alarms her enough to take a photo, the prosecutor says. It includes a drawing of a handgun and the words: \"The thoughts won't stop. Help me.\" Also depicted is a bullet with the words \"blood everywhere\" above a person who appears to have been shot twice and is bleeding. A laughing emoji is drawn below the figure. The note also says \"my life is useless\" and \"the world is dead.\" The teacher reports the information to school counselors and the dean.\n\nA counselor removes Ethan from the classroom and takes him to the office with his backpack.

The agency is amending the emergency use authorizations (EUA) for COVID-19 vaccines to allow for the use of a single booster dose as follows:\n\nThe use of a single booster dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine that may be administered at least 6 months after completion of the primary series to individuals: 65 years of age and older 18 through 64 years of age at high risk of severe COVID-19 18 through 64 years of age with frequent institutional or occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2\n\nThe use of a single booster dose of the Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) COVID-19 Vaccine may be administered at least 2 months after completion of the single-dose primary regimen to individuals 18 years of age and older.\n\nThe use of each of the available COVID-19 vaccines as a heterologous (or \"mix and match\") booster dose in eligible individuals following completion of primary vaccination with a different available COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nTo clarify that a single booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may be administered at least 6 months after completion of the primary series to individuals 18 through 64 years of age with frequent institutional or occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\"Today's actions demonstrate our commitment to public health in proactively fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. \"As the pandemic continues to impact the country, science has shown that vaccination continues to be the safest and most effective way to prevent COVID-19, including the most serious consequences of the disease, such as hospitalization and death. The available data suggest waning immunity in some populations who are fully vaccinated. The availability of these authorized boosters is important for continued protection against COVID-19 disease.\"\n\n\"The amendments to the emergency use authorizations to include a single booster dose in eligible populations are based on the available data and information and follows the input from the members of our advisory committee who were supportive of the use of a booster dose of these vaccines in eligible populations,\" said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. \"We are also taking action today to include the use of mix and match boosters to address this public health need. We will work to accrue additional data as quickly as possible to further assess the benefits and risks of the use of booster doses in additional populations and plan to update the healthcare community and public with our determination in the coming weeks.\"\n\nAuthorization of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Dose\n\nTo support the authorization for emergency use of a single booster dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, the FDA analyzed immune response data from 149 participants 18 years of age and older from the original clinical studies who received a booster dose at least 6 months after their second dose and compared it to the immune responses of 1,055 study participants after completing their two-dose series. The antibody response of the 149 participants against SARS-CoV-2 virus 29 days after a booster dose of the vaccine demonstrated a booster response.\n\nThe FDA also evaluated an additional analysis from Moderna comparing the rates of COVID-19 accrued during the Delta variant surge during July and August 2021, which suggest that there is a waning of vaccine effectiveness over time.\n\nSafety was evaluated in 171 participants 18 years of age and older who were followed for an average of approximately six months. The most commonly reported side effects by the clinical trial participants who received the booster dose of the vaccine were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and/or joint pain, chills, swollen lymph nodes in same arm as the injection, nausea and vomiting, and fever. Of note, swollen lymph nodes in the underarm were observed more frequently following the booster dose than after the primary two-dose series."}

I saw a few joke tweets suggesting people were trapped in the metaverse, and I thought to myself... what happens to an Oculus Quest when Facebook is down? Would Facebook's new camera-studded sunglasses still work? With Facebook's focus increasingly turned to a virtual and augmented reality-driven future of work and communication, amid all sorts of already-shaky problems with its platform, it's a question you might be having too.\n\nThe answer is: a weird and unfortunate mix. My Oculus headset still started up, and it still brought up a familiar virtual living room and showed me the list of apps I had installed. But Facebook's services underneath were gone. No app store. No avatars. No Facebook friends. Even the app icon graphics weren't loading.\n\nBut I could start games I had downloaded, no problem. I booted up Walkabout Mini Golf and played a hole or two; I even connected to randomly play with someone else online. I loaded Microsoft's Altspace VR and found a meditation class midsession, avatars floating around like everything was just fine.\n\nThe Oculus Quest 2, which requires a Facebook login to work, is sort of half in and half out of Facebook's cloud universe. A lot of the Quest is an Android-based piece of hardware that downloads apps and works like a game console. But what happens when Facebook's always-connected ties extend even further through the Oculus OS, when Facebook's dream of a metaverse layer of software becomes possibly the replacement to apps as we know them now? What happens when Facebook finally makes the cloud-connected, AI-driven AR glasses it is on a clear trajectory to deliver this decade?\n\nI put Facebook's newest Ray-Ban smart glasses on my face next -- the photo-taking, audio-connected sunglasses released last month -- but I didn't get very far. The Facebook-connected app on my phone, which is the only place the glasses can download its photos and videos to, wouldn't log in. I was locked out. I was also locked out of my photos.\n\nTo be clear: App- and cloud-connected devices and services (and the inherent problems) aren't unique to Facebook. Try using a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X when the PlayStation Network or Xbox Live are down. Some parts work, others don't. Try using Netflix or Disney Plus during an outage. So many services we use are cloud-based now. We're used to putting our lives somewhere else; always-on wearables are no different. Some parts will work, no doubt, and others won't. Facebook's glasses don't need to be online to take photos and video -- but they need that phone app to share them.\n\nThere are plenty of sci-fi books that have imagined a coming apocalypse of half-collapsed infrastructures: Tim Maughan's Infinite Detail is a great starting point. In that book, a rebel community in the UK has decided to take down a grid of smart tech, which causes the world to reboot and learn to live without the familiar shrouds of assisted tech.\n\nEvery time there's a power outage or cellular networks go down, we rediscover this feeling and wonder about our reliance on Google, on phones, on all our social networks. The future of AR and VR doesn't necessarily need to feel this way: Lots of existing hardware can use on-device processing to handle VR graphics or AR effects, so they'll work even when there's no online connection. That needs to remain the case."}

They were joined by the congressional leaders of both parties.\n\nIncoming presidents typically attend services on the morning of their inauguration, often at St. John's Episcopal Church, a small church across Lafayette Square from the White House known as \"The Church of the Presidents.\"\n\nBiden arrives at Capitol\n\nBiden arrived at the US Capitol shortly after 11 a.m. and Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, accompanied him and Jill Biden up the steps of the iconic building.\n\nWhen Biden arrived at the inauguration stage, he greeted his predecessor and former boss, former President Barack Obama, on his way to his seat. He received a lengthy ovation from those gathered on the stage and sat down at 11:19 a.m.\n\nHarris and Obama first bump\n\nAs she walked to her seat on the inaugural stage, Harris shared double fist bumps with Obama.\n\nThe gesture, exchanged shortly before Harris was sworn in as vice president, carried symbolic weight as Obama and Harris made history as the first African Americans to serve as president and vice president, respectively.\n\nHarris similarly fist bumped Michelle Obama, who made history as the country's first African American first lady.\n\nHarris is sworn in as vice president\n\nHarris took the oath of office at 11:42 a.m. She used two Bibles during the oath, which was administered by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nHarris officially became the first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president at noon.\n\nBiden is sworn in as the 46th president\n\nBiden completed his oath of office at 11:48 a.m., using a treasured family Bible that dates to the 19th century and was held by Jill Biden.

The study found 89% of those polled in Harris County said they lost electrical power, compared to 71% of Texans overall. When asked what was the most serious problem faced in Harris County during the storm, 74% considered power loss the most serious issue, with loss of running water in a close second at 71%.\n\nThroughout the storm, Harris County residents lost an average of 49 hours of power. Houston's main energy provider, CenterPoint, was unable to provide sustainable rolling power outages. As a result, three-quarters of Harris County survey participants said there should be developments in other energy sources, such as wind and solar, to protect the country's energy supply.\n\n\"When it comes to supporting proposed policy changes aimed at protecting people and infrastructure from severe weather, an overwhelming majority of Harris County residents think it's a good idea, but the challenge comes with how to fund those improvements,\" wroteRenée Cross, senior director at the Hobby School.\n\nWith a majority of Harris County left without power, residents were forced to turn to alternative methods of keeping their homes warm. Among those who stayed in their homes without power, 34% used a natural gas oven or cooktop to keep warm.\n\nOftentimes, Harris County residents put their own health at risk: 9% of residents surveyed used a grill or smoker indoors, while 8% used an outdoor propane heater indoors, despite the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nSurvey respondents said storm preparedness was lacking, showing an overwhelming 79% of participants who did not agree power cuts were distributed in an equitable manner.\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas received a 78% disapproval rating, the highest disapproval percentage calculated, followed by Gov. Greg Abbott, who had a 56% disapproval rating in his job performance.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo had the highest approval rating, at 49% and 48%, respectively.\n\nIn addition, many Harris County residents relied on text alerts from local and county government during the storm, despite many residents having poor or no cell reception.\n\n\"This suggests the text-alert systems of Harris County, the city of Houston and other area municipalities might serve as an example for other governments,\" wrote Hobby School Senior Research Associate Mark P.

Try as you might however, you won't find that needed renewal by what you read in the media — the Fourth Estate — as the American press is not your partner in restoring your faith in America, its sacred institutions or its people. Instead, the media are pot-stirrers of the first order and shameless instigators of division.\n\nAs found in a recent Reuters Institute Poll, the United States press ranks last in media trust, at 29 percent, which is about seven points lower than Joe Biden's present approval rating, indicating just how low the press can go.\n\nNowhere was this lack of trust more magnified than in the media's reporting of the State of Wisconsin vs. Kyle Rittenhouse.\n\nIf you truly believed all of the amalgamated press on the Kyle Rittenhouse case prior to the presentation of a somewhat important thing called \"evidence\" at an \"actual trial\", you might have been led to believe that: Kyle Rittenhouse was a white supremacist/domestic terrorist who carried an illegal rifle across state lines to Kenosha, WI, a place upon which he had no ties, to murder two black men and recklessly and without cause, injure a third man during an otherwise peaceful, non-violent civil protest on Aug. 25, 2020.\n\nWell, at least part of that above scenario is true; Kyle Rittenhouse was in Kenosha on Aug. 25. The rest was simply a false narrative pushed by an irresponsible media.\n\nNo evidence existed that Rittenhouse believed in the superiority of the white race and as was the case with Loudon County Virginia parents (complaining to their school board over CRT instruction and same-sex bathrooms) there equally was zero evidence to label Mr. Rittenhouse a domestic terrorist.\n\nMoreover, he did not carry a rifle across state lines and it was not illegal for him to possess that rifle under Wisconsin Law which is made infinitely clear by photos, post verdict, of a 16 year old black female carrying a similar rifle in Kenosha while providing security for those protesting the Rittenhouse verdict."}

(AP) — Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl throwing to Troy Brown, Jermaine Wiggins and David Patten and earned his seventh ring firing passes to Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Antonio Brown and Rob Gronkowski.\n\nThere's a significant talent gap between his first crew of journeymen in New England and the all-star cast he has in Tampa Bay, but the common theme is No. 12.\n\nBrady won with Deion Branch, David Givens, Brandon LaFell, Malcolm Mitchell, Chris Hogan and Danny Amendola, and he helped Julian Edelman and Wes Welker become stars.\n\nHe's relied on throwing to his running backs from J.R. Redmond and Kevin Faulk to Shane Vereen and James White. His tight ends have always been favorite targets from Wiggins, Daniel Graham and Benjamin Watson to Aaron Hernandez, Martellus Bennett and Gronkowski.\n\nBrady's best receiver along the way was Hall of Famer Randy Moss. They broke records together and went 16-0 in 2007 but didn't win it all.\n\nThe 44-year-old, five-time Super Bowl MVP faces the Patriots on Sunday night for the first time since leaving New England after 20 years. He'll see plenty of familiar faces on the opposite sideline, including his leading receiver from their first Super Bowl victory two decades ago.\n\nTroy Brown caught six of Brady's passes for 89 yards when the Patriots stunned the \"Greatest Show on Turf\" Rams in Super Bowl 36. Brown now coaches New England's wide receivers and kick returners.\n\n\"I played with the guy for a long time and coached with him for a couple of years while he was here,\" Brown said. \"It's a little bit awkward, but at the end of the day, it's still about competing and going against each other. That's what it comes down to. I mean, I know I'm not playing, but still, you're approaching the game as we do every other team around the league, is that we do everything we can to prepare for what they have. We'll approach this game the same way, not because Tom Brady is Tom Brady or whatever it is, because it's the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. We have a really good football team all around.\"\n\nBrown isn't surprised Brady is still playing at an elite level all these years later. The GOAT already has 10 touchdown passes in three games, putting him on pace to set a new career high. He threw 50 TD passes, including 23 to Moss, in '07.\n\n\"Well, I think if anybody can pull it off, it would be Tom Brady,\" Brown said. \"He's been that type of guy his entire career. No reason to think that he wouldn't still be playing. He said when he came into the league that he would play forever. And so, he's trying to make that come true, I guess.\"\n\nWiggins had two catches for 14 yards in New England's first Super Bowl win. The Boston native can't believe Brady switched teams.\n\n\"I still haven't been able to get over it since he left here. I never thought I'd see it coming where he'd be wearing another uniform,\" Wiggins said. \"Brady I thought would be that guy that I thought the only uniform he would wear would be the New England Patriots one. Then when he left, it was weird to see him in that Tampa Bay uniform. To this day I can't get used to it because that championship he won down there I feel like could have been another one he won in New England.\"\n\nPatriots coach Bill Belichick said earlier this week he didn't want Brady to leave.\n\n\"He looked at his options and made his decision. We weren't as good of an option as Tampa,\" Belichick said on his weekly radio appearance on WEEI. \"You'd have to ask him about all that, but it wasn't a question of not wanting him, that's for sure.\"\n\nBrady wouldn't elaborate on a report that Belichick spoke to him on the phone instead of meeting with him in person when he was a free agent last year."}

These new payments are already in the pipeline\n\nScores of lawmakers want to give Americans a fourth pandemic relief payment — and maybe more beyond that. But it's not clear whether House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders will roll a new stimulus check into upcoming legislation to fix U.S. infrastructure and help families.\n\nAnd, there's no guarantee a fourth round of direct aid would ever win approval. Republicans can be counted on to oppose it, and moderate Democrats probably wouldn't support the idea either. They questioned whether the recent third stimulus checks were necessary.\n\nBut if you're eager for another payment, to help you cover your bills and pay down debt, more federal money may already be pointed in your direction. At the very least, it's within reach.\n\nHere are a few ways you can get what might be considered a fourth stimulus check, without any new action from Congress.\n\nMonthly stimulus checks for families start up soon\n\n@natasha_lebedinskaya / Twenty20\n\nStarting July 15, the IRS will send out monthly payments to households, under a temporary expansion of the child tax credit that was included in the COVID stimulus bill President Joe Biden signed in March.\n\nFor six months, families will receive $250 for each child ages 6 to 17, and $300 for every kid younger than 6.\n\nThe checks will provide half the expanded credit for 2021. The rest can be taken as refunds when recipients file income taxes next year.\n\nThe full credit is worth $3,000 for 6- to 17-year-olds, and $3,600 for every child under 6. The usual maximum credit is $2,000 per kid, and only up to age 16.\n\nIf your family has filed your taxes this year, the IRS should have enough information to give you your child credit payments. If you don't normally file a return, the tax agency recently launched a non-filer sign-up tool you can use to make sure you get whatever child tax credit funds you qualify for.\n\nHomeowners can get stimulus checks\n\nThough the pandemic ushered in ultra-low mortgage rates that have showered many homeowners with refinance savings, others are still struggling to make their house payments.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you're having trouble staying current on your mortgage and worry you might be headed for delinquency or even foreclosure, the government has money to help.\n\nBiden's COVID rescue package from March created a $10 billion homeowner assistance fund. A minimum $50 million has been appropriated for each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\n\nTo get your share of the mortgage relief, you'll have to provide evidence you're under financial stress due to COVID. You're eligible if you earn no more than 150% of your area's median income, and if your loan balance doesn't exceed $548,250.\n\nYou apply for the homeowners assistance through your state's housing agency.\n\nStimulus cash is available for renters, too\n\nIn the two most recent pandemic relief bills — the one from March and an earlier one signed in December — Congress approved a total of $46.6 billion in emergency aid for tenants who can't afford to pay rent.\n\nThe National Low Income Housing Coalition calls the amount of support available for renters \"unprecedented.\"\n\nYou can receive help if you're able to provide proof that you're struggling to pay rent or utilities because of the pandemic, and that you're facing a risk of homelessness.\n\nRenters who qualify can get up to 18 months of assistance to cover both missed and future rent. In one state, eligible renters can receive as much as $4,600 a month; in another, they can get lump sums of up to $25,000.\n\nThe funds are being distributed by more than 400 state and local agencies.\n\nWhat about a real fourth stimulus check?\n\nU.S. senators, members of the influential House Ways and Means Committee and millions of petition signers all have made the case that many Americans still require financial assistance due to ongoing disruptions from the pandemic."}

As of April 16th, there have been 147 mass shootings in the United States. Since the start of the trial against former cop Derek Chauvin for the recorded murder of George Floyd, a mere three weeks ago, there have been more than 60 people killed by police officers. More than half of them were Black or of Latin American descent. Without researching the details, I can guarantee that a vast majority, if not all of them involved a gun.\n\nThis isn't going to be the typical liberal rant about how guns are evil and they all need to disappear. I mean, I wouldn't be mad if they did, but I have no delusions. I grew up in Florida, and I know how much some of you worship your weapons. What I've never been able to figure out, though, is why cops and their representatives so often come out on the side against gun reform? Inevitably, whenever there's a police-involved shooting, the cop in question always claims to have shot the victim because they had a gun, or at least the cop claims to have seen one. Felt one? Sensed one? I don't know, but cops seem to always be operating under the perceived threat of being shot at by someone. And the thing is, they're not entirely wrong.\n\nThe United States, as we all know, is the most heavily armed society in the world, averaging 1.2 guns per person living here. And in spite of the common myth about all the good guys with guns, studies show that areas with more guns have more homicides. It's not a complicated concept and hardly seems to warrant a study; deadly weapons attract, maybe even manifest, violent death. Who would've thought?\n\nOfficers aren't immune to this disease, of course. They also face death by gun at higher rates in jurisdictions with lax gun laws. Which then lands us in a vicious loop because in these places with higher gun ownership, where cops can rightly assume that just about anyone is at least physically capable of shooting them, they are more likely to use lethal force. So whether you had a gun at some point but tossed it, like 13-year-old Adam Toledo; or whether you were playing with a toy gun at a park, like 12-year-old Tamir Rice; or if you were legally purchasing a gun inside the store where they sell them, like John Crawford III; or if you announced that you were legally carrying your weapon to the cop who pulled you over for a broken taillight, like Philando Castile; whatever the circumstances under which you might so much as appear to have a deadly firearm, which then may or may not end up pointed at a cop, you've now become the deadly threat yourself and lethal use of force is now justified."}

Images showed the ship's bow was touching the eastern wall, while its stern looked lodged against the western wall — an extraordinary event that experts said they had never heard of happening before in the canal's 150-year history.\n\nTugboats strained Wednesday to try to nudge the obstruction out of the way as ships hoping to enter the waterway began lining up in the Mediterranean and Red Seas. But it remained unclear when the route, through which around 10% of world trade flows and which is particularly crucial for the transport of oil, would reopen. One official warned it could take at least two days. In the meantime, there were concerns that idling ships could become targets for attacks.\n\n\"The Suez Canal will not spare any efforts to ensure the restoration of navigation and to serve the movement of global trade,\" vowed Lt.

GAC, a global shipping and logistics company, said the ship had experienced a blackout without elaborating.\n\nBernhard Schulte, however, denied the ship ever lost power.\n\nEvergreen Marine Corp., a major Taiwan-based shipping company that operates the ship, said in a statement that the Ever Given had been overcome by strong winds as it entered the canal from the Red Sea but none of its containers had sunk.\n\nAn Egyptian official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to brief journalists, similarly blamed a strong wind. Egyptian forecasters said high winds and a sandstorm plagued the area Tuesday, with winds gusting as much as 50 kph (30 mph).\n\nHowever, it remained unclear how winds of that speed alone would have been able to push a fully laden vessel weighing some 220,000 tons."}

The man's wife said she heard a splash after he went outside his home one day after Hurricane Ida blew through the area and walked out to see him being attacked by the alligator, which had already ripped one of his arms off. The woman then took off in a boat to find an area with a cell signal to dial 911, but Satterlee had disappeared when she got back to the house—along with the alligator. Local sheriff's deputies found the enormous alligator near Satterlee's home two weeks after the attack, at which point they captured and killed it, finding human remains inside. Preston said he will likely rule the death was an accident.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nThere are more than 2 million alligators living in the wild in Louisiana, but the reptiles rarely attack humans. Fatal attacks are essentially unheard of, but at least one other death in the state's history is believed to be the result of an alligator attack.

We hadn't seen her in a little bit,\" the owner of the store said Tuesday. \"Before she went on the trip, she stopped in to buy her boyfriend a shirt.\"\n\nLaundrie returned to the Florida Gulf Coast town of North Port, where their trip began, on Sept. 1 without Petito but with her white van.\n\nThe van was seized from the Laundrie family's Florida home on Sept. 11 after her family officially reported her missing earlier that same day, and Laundrie was named a person of interest in her disappearance on Sept. 15.\n\nLaundrie disappeared himself on Sept. 14. A team of FBI agents then swarmed the family's house on Monday and authorities have been searching for him in a nearby nature reserve as well as other locations around Florida.\n\nOther friends and family of Petito echoed the surf shop owner's sentiments about her.\n\n\"She's so creative and artistic and talented and sweet,\" Nichole Schmidt, Petito's mother, told Fox News last week before her daughter's remains were found.\n\n\"She's a typical 22-year-old who just wants to live life, go on adventures, start a YouTube account and travel and teach other people how to do it.\"\n\nPetito's best friend in Florida said that she \"made a mark on anyone she came in contact with.\"\n\n\"Even [if] it was a quick interaction. She not only sees the light in everyone but spreads her light with everyone,\" the friend told Fox News. \"At my lowest, she managed to help me keep my chin up.\""}

Several viewers have called in and reported struggles finding gas.\n\nThose stations who had gas -- like the Walmart on Mobile Highway -- had long lines of cars waiting to fuel up.\n\nColonial Pipeline was forced to shut down Friday after a ransomware attack. AAA says most of Florida's gas is shipped in, so the pipeline shutdown most likely won't affect local supplies. But it could still drive up prices.\n\nHowever, the Florida Department of Agriculture said Monday afternoon that the Colonial Pipeline hack is one reason for the gas shortage, while a truck driver shortage is another.\n\nThe agency added that the Pensacola fuel terminal is also to blame, saying the company didn't meet EPA standards required by May 1.\n\n\"FDACS was recently alerted to a potential disruption in the fuel supply impacting the Pensacola region,\" Nikki Fried says in a release. \"This specific disruption is due to a company servicing that area that is unable to meet EPA standards on federal gasoline requirements under the Clean Air Act, which must be met annually by May 1. Given the federal regulation of this issue, FDACS immediately contacted the EPA to ensure situational awareness and facilitate direct communication with industry operators. We continue to encourage the company to quickly resolve this issue and mitigate any impact on the community and residents.\"\n\nChannel 3 reached out to the EPA, which said they were working to find more information.\n\nThe message from gas stations and the state: don't panic buy, form long lines or hoard gas.\n\nFor some drivers, the impact goes beyond inconvenience.\n\n\"It's kind of scary when it's raining because I don't want to be stuck on the side of the road with my daughter with no gas,\" Pensacola resident Tieisha Brown said. \"So this is my second attempt and I'm slowly but surely running low on gas trying to find a gas station.\""}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is scheduled to meet Friday to discuss further clinical recommendations regarding immunocompromised individuals. Today's action does not apply to people who are not immunocompromised.\n\n\"The country has entered yet another wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the FDA is especially cognizant that immunocompromised people are particularly at risk for severe disease. After a thorough review of the available data, the FDA determined that this small, vulnerable group may benefit from a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna Vaccines,\" said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. \"Today's action allows doctors to boost immunity in certain immunocompromised individuals who need extra protection from COVID-19. As we've previously stated, other individuals who are fully vaccinated are adequately protected and do not need an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine at this time. The FDA is actively engaged in a science-based, rigorous process with our federal partners to consider whether an additional dose may be needed in the future.\"\n\nPeople who are immunocompromised in a manner similar to those who have undergone solid organ transplantation have a reduced ability to fight infections and other diseases, and they are especially vulnerable to infections, including COVID-19. The FDA evaluated information on the use of a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna Vaccines in these individuals and determined that the administration of third vaccine doses may increase protection in this population. These patients should be counseled to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, close contacts of immunocompromised persons should get vaccinated, as appropriate for their health status, to provide increased protection to their loved ones.\n\nIt is recommended that immunocompromised individuals discuss monoclonal antibody treatment options with their health care provider should they contract or be exposed to COVID-19. The FDA has authorized monoclonal antibody treatments for emergency use during this public health emergency for adults and pediatric patients (ages 12 and older weighing at least 40 kilograms or about 88 pounds) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. One authorized product includes use for preventative (prophylaxis) treatment after being exposed to SARS-CoV-2; however, this product is not a substitute for vaccination.\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is currently authorized for emergency use in individuals ages 12 and older, and the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is authorized for emergency use in individuals ages 18 and older. Both vaccines are administered as a series of two shots: the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is administered three weeks apart, and the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is administered one month apart. The authorizations for these vaccines have been amended to allow for an additional, or third, dose to be administered at least 28 days following the two-dose regimen of the same vaccine to individuals 18 years of age or older (ages 12 or older for Pfizer-BioNTech) who have undergone solid organ transplantation, or who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise."}

Sergeant Jason Leorwald said the police department is working to try to make a path to get to those residents and resources to them Sunday night and are opening search and rescue cases as well.\n\n\"They're scared because they've never seen this,\" Leorwald said. \"They've never faced a storm like this before. Our residents have gone through this their whole lives and they didn't think that this would happen.\"\n\nFor the residents that stayed, Leorwald called it a \"personal decision,\" noting that some people couldn't afford to leave.\n\nIn an interview with Gulf States Newsroom reporter Shalina Chatlani, Rodriguez details information he's received from police officers working in Jean Lafitte and explains how the situation is likely more catastrophic than when Hurricane Katrina hit the area 16 years ago.\n\nHere is a transcription of their conversation:\n\nShalina Chatlani: Hi, Sheriff Rodriguez. Thanks for talking to me about the situation in Jean Lafitte, which is closer to the coast than New Orleans. I know that you're not there right now. You're in the sheriff's office, but you're getting reports and deputies. What are you hearing about the situation down there?\n\nMarcel Rodriguez: I'm hearing that it's not good. They've got people that's trapped back there and there's no way to get home. And the last I heard in lower Lafitte is they had about 10 feet of water. But from what I just got off the phone when I was interrupted earlier, the water's still piling in. So I don't know where it's going to stop. And, you know, I'm 70 years old. I grew up back there and I've never seen anything like this. This is a storm from the left side of Lafitte. Everybody knows that it would be bad. But, you know, this is a Cat 4, from what I understand is still a Cat 4. This is going to be a nightmare.\n\nSC: And I take it you're getting calls from residents as well. What are you hearing?"}

The outage lasted about six hours during the work day, and while it may have provided reprieve for some, it likely resulted in chaos for others.\n\nFor many brands and organizations, Facebook serves as the main platform for advertising, retail outreach, virtual events and customer service. Some smaller businesses even use it as an alternative to a website to distribute information and promote their brand. However, much like any other service, especially a free one, users should prepare for closures or resource failures.\n\nThe Problem of Over-Reliance\n\nJohn Guilfoil, principal, John Guilfoil Public Relations LLC, provides PR and communication consulting services to more than 400 entities in 11 states, including municipalities such as public schools, police and fire departments. He counsels they not rely on a single platform or service, though he admits social media is important.\n\n\"Police and fire departments are like small-to-medium corporations,\" Guilfoil says. \"They are budget-conscious and rarely have the funds for dedicated public relations staff. As a result, employees like police officers and firefighters end up assuming multiple roles in an agency and their time is stretched thin. This allows for the possibility of over-reliance on a single, familiar platform like Facebook. This is dangerous.\"\n\nGuilfoil says many small-business owners, as well as town fire chiefs, feel they don't need a website. And they don't believe in updating sites. They use Facebook instead.\n\n\"Yesterday, I went to some of their websites, and instead of a functioning news blog with lists of headlines and news stories, there was a small blank box where their Facebook page feed widget had been,\" he says. \"When Facebook went down, their ability to communicate went down with it and their news archive disappeared too.\"\n\nUtilizing Holistic Communication\n\nIt can be daunting or even intimidating for a small business or municipality to consider creating a website. However, Guilfoil advocates free, simple tools that help keep information updated in multiple places on the web. He points to sites like WordPress to launch a basic, responsive and ADA-compliant website.\n\n\"We integrate websites into social media and email marketing software, but we teach our clients 'web first,' even in 2021,\" he says. \"If we do our job correctly, we can not only save hours a week in manual posting time, but we can redundantly ensure that customers, voters, residents and stakeholders are less likely to miss content from our clients.\"\n\nDuring the Facebook outage, those Guilfoil advises were able to reach audiences because, while Facebook was down, their websites, Twitter, LinkedIn and email systems were up and running. And that's an important lesson—backup systems are important not just for Facebook, but other content platforms."}

But that's where we are this week as Woods competes in the PNC Championship alongside his son, Charlie, at The Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando.\n\nWhat can we expect from Woods this week, and the rest of the year? It all depends on his body. That's been his truth for awhile, and will be his truth going forward — \"It's my reality and I've accepted it,\" Woods told Golf Digest recently. Woods suffered open fractures to both the tibia and fibula in his lower right leg. Less serious but concurrent damage occurred with Woods' ankle and soft tissue in his lower leg. And less than a year later, he's clearly able to peg it in a reasonable way right now.\n\nWhen Woods hosted 20 of the best players in the world at the Hero World Challenge earlier this month, he clued us in a bit to where his body is at, and what his rehab process has been like. Woods was largely bedridden for three months following the surgeries to his lower body, but he did walk with crutches about two months after the accident, by his estimate. He also admitted that he probably walked without crutches a bit earlier than his doctors advised him to.\n\nIn the months that followed the accident, Woods said, he was gracious just to go outside and feel the sun on his face. \"It's hard to explain how difficult it has been just to be immobile for the three months, just lay there and I was just looking forward to getting outside.\"\n\nWoods' recovery, in terms of golf, has meant chipping and putting in his backyard, and playing short-game competitions against Charlie. Positive as that may be, Woods noted that he is not able to grind through practice sessions like he used to, like during his comeback prior to this one.\n\n\"I don't foresee this leg ever being what it used to be, hence I'll never have the back what it used to be, and clock's ticking,\" Woods told reporters. \"I'm getting older, I'm not getting any younger. All that combined means that a full schedule and a full practice schedule and the recovery that it would take to do that, no, I don't have any desire to do that.\"\n\nDespite the uphill battle he still has ahead of him, Woods did practice repeatedly during the week in the Bahamas. He spent multiple days during the course of the tournament hitting full swing shots — even drivers — on the end of the driving range. So, how would he guess his future looks competing with his body on the PGA Tour? Woods has decided to invoke the story of Ben Hogan, who survived an auto accident to return and win at the highest level of the game."}

After three and a half days of deliberation, a jury acquitted Rittenhouse of all felony counts, including first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, attempted first-degree intentional homicide, and two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety.\n\nRittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the shooting, lived in Antioch, Illinois; he crossed state lines, picked up an illegally obtained AR15 rifle from a friend's stepfather, and embedded with a self-described militia purportedly protecting a local business from demonstrators out after curfew. That week, Kenosha saw sustained protests after local police shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, in the back with his children watching. Rittenhouse — a former police cadet and a Trump supporter with a strong \"Blues Lives Matter\" social-media presence — told a right-wing media outlet that he was there doing his \"job,\" though he had taken it upon himself to help guard the car dealership. And when a confrontation broke out, Rittenhouse fired at a group of people appearing to chase him, killing 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum. Shortly after that, he shot and killed 26-year-old Anthony Huber, also injuring 26-year-old Gaige Grosskreutz.\n\nWith Fox News personalities hailing him as a hero, and even the then-president defending him, Rittenhouse was charged with first-degree intentional homicide days later. Kenosha prosecutors also charged him with two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety, one count of first-degree reckless homicide, one count of attempted first-degree intentional homicide, one count of possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18, and also for violating curfew. He pleaded not guilty to all, claiming he shot his victims in self-defense. His trial began on November 2.\n\nWhat did the prosecution argue?\n\nIn his opening statements, prosecutor Thomas Binger emphasized that although hundreds of people \"experienced the night of August 25, experienced the chaos — the only one who killed anyone was the defendant, Kyle Rittenhouse.\" Binger positioned Rittenhouse as the instigator of deadly conflict, one of the outsiders drawn to unrest in Kenosha \"like moths to a flame.\""}

Around 1.2 billion tons passed through the canal on 19,000 ships in 2019 – roughly one eighth of all goods transported by sea that year.\n\nMillions of tons of manufactured goods make their way from China and South Asia to Europe via the canal. It's also a key route for oil tankers going to and from the Middle East.\n\nThe Ever Given has run aground at a busy time of year. Trade is picking up after the Chinese New Year which sees factories close down in the world's manufacturing powerhouse.\n\nBusinesses are seeking to restock in the hope that coronavirus restrictions will ease in the coming months.\n\nThere is already a global shortage of shipping container space and Covid-19 safety procedures have been causing delays at ports.\n\nWhat impact will the blockage have?\n\nDelays have already begun in the hours following the incident. About 42 vessels seeking to travel northbound and 64 southbound are now waiting, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe longer the Ever Given is stuck the more that number will rise. Around 10 million barrels of oil and petrol are reportedly backed up near the entrances of the canal.\n\nChris Evans, international supply chain expert at Colliers International, was confident the Ever Given would be moved quickly, meaning delays to goods shipments would be minimised.\n\n\"If it doesn't get cleared quickly it will cause a lot of delay and people will have to start looking at shipping goods via the Cape of Good Hope,\" he said.\n\n\"It will cause a hiccup and bunching of ships at various ports in Europe. Anything that's behind it will come rushing through. Discharging vessels is already slow because of Covid procedures, as is pick-up of containers.\n\nHe added: \"The knock-on effect, the delays, start to build very quickly. We will have to go back to that old-fashioned thing: patience.\"\n\nWhile most ships are at sea for weeks and can absorb a couple of days of delay, a backlog at ports can cause issues rapidly, Mr Evans said.\n\n\"Only modern ports like London and Thames Gateway can cope with it. Volume soon builds up, it doesn't take long.\n\nHowever, he was sanguine about the impact on businesses and consumers. \"I wouldn't have thought there's any major cost impact for businesses. We should not worry too much about gaps in supplies of products.\"\n\nSamir Madani at TankerTrackers told the Financial Times: \"The canal is a key chokepoint for global trade.\n\n\"If they can free the vessel quickly then the impact will be minimised but any prolonged blockage would have severe consequences, from affecting oil prices and shipping rates to forcing container vessels to take the much longer route around Africa.\""}

On Tuesday, Portland Public Schools also had to issue lockdowns and lockouts for three schools after a student allegedly robbed another with a weapon off campus, then came to school. Lebanon High School also was locked down, and South Albany High School had a false report of threat, as reported by the Albany Democrat-Herald.\n\n\"We've spoken to many, many parents this week who are concerned about this across the region,\" said Kraig Sproles, superintendent of the Bethel School District. \"What we're seeing is a lot of our students either hearing about a threat or mentioning it themselves. And we need to take that really seriously.\"\n\nIt's not surprising there were more threat concerns on the heels of Nov. 30 shooting in Michigan, Sproles said, as people often are more anxious following a violent act at schools involving guns.\n\n\"So I think that's part of it, but I also just think it's at a time when we as a society are a little bit more on edge and less resilient than we normally would be,\" he said.\n\nBethel had three separate incidents that were reported to staff last week, he said. One was regarding a text back-and-forth between two students in conflict. Another was a student conversation that involved a gun.\n\nSproles said they took care of that second incident, \"but then it kind of took on a life of its own on social media.\"\n\nSupporting students: How parents can help students cope with Oxford school shooting\n\nThe third was regarding a Willamette High School student who said they had a gun at school, prompting students to alert staff and have a brief lockdown Tuesday. When Eugene police responded and searched the student, no weapon was found. The student purported to have a gun and was carrying \"another object\" that could give the appearance of a gun, Eugene police spokesperson Melinda McLaughlin said Wednesday.

To improve on this, the district is planning on holding a meeting with Willamette High parents this week, with the central topic of how to better work together.\n\n\"I think for parents, we need a little bit of feedback on the communication they expect during an emergency and what we can commit to providing,\" Sproles said.\n\nStudents also will be having more focused conversations about the incidents in homeroom."}

Woods, the 45-year-old golf legend, was the only person in the vehicle, which sustained \"major damage\" in the crash, officials said.\n\nWoods is awake, responsive and recovering from a \"long surgical procedure\" on his lower right leg and ankle, according to a statement posted on his Twitter account early Wednesday. \"We thank everyone for the overwhelming support and messages during this tough time.\"\n\nDeputies responded to the scene at 7:12 a.m. local time Tuesday, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. His SUV careened downhill, traveling several hundred feet, flipping multiple times before landing on a hillside in a Los Angeles suburb.\n\nWoods was trapped inside, forcing first responders to use tools to pry open the windshield to pull Woods out, local officials said. The beloved golfer was transported to the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where he required emergency surgery.\n\n\"Mr. Woods suffered significant orthopedic injuries to his right lower extremity that were treated during emergency surgery,\" said Dr. Anish Mahajan, the hospital's chief medical officer and interim CEO.\n\nWoods' SUV — a 2021 Genesis GV80 — was the only vehicle involved in the crash. Photos and video from the scene showed extensive damage to the vehicle's front-end. The golfer's clubs and other personal items were taken from the scene and a crane later removed the crumpled SUV.\n\nSheriff Alex Villanueva said investigators are \"purely\" treating the crash as an accident. \"We don't contemplate any charges whatsoever,\" he said.\n\nVillanueva has said there were no initial signs that Woods was impaired. The interior of the SUV remained intact, which gave Woods the cushion to survive, Villanueva said, adding the investigation could take weeks.\n\nDeputy Carlos Gonzalez, who responded to the scene, said Woods was calm but unable to stand on his own. \"I asked what his name was, he told me his name was Tiger and at that moment, I immediately recognized him,\" Gonzalez told reporters Tuesday. \"He seemed as though he was lucid and calm.\"\n\nGonzalez said Woods was wearing his seatbelt, which \"greatly increased\" his chances of surviving. The deputy called the stretch of roadway a \"problem area\" for speeding and accidents. \"It was very fortunate that Mr. Woods came out of this alive,\" he said.\n\nSince last January, there were 13 accidents on the same stretch of road, Villanueva said.\n\nWoods, a Florida resident, was in Los Angeles to host his annual golf tournament, the Genesis Invitational. He spent the past two days filming with Discovery's Golf TV with comedian David Spade and former NBA player Dwyane Wade, who posted a video of their meetup.\n\nWoods, widely considered one of the greatest golfers of all-time, has 82 career PGA Tour wins, including 15 major championships. He has been recovering from back surgery and has not played since the PNC Championship in December.\n\nOn February 16, Woods said he was still rehabbing after the procedure but did not confirm whether he would play at the Masters in April. \"I'm feeling fine, I'm feeling fine. I'm a little bit stiff,\" Woods said last week. \"Still in the gym, still doing the mundane stuff that you have to do for rehab.\"\n\nProfessional golfers, athletes and celebrities, including Jack Nicklaus, Alex Rodriguez and Magic Johnson, sent Woods well wishes as he recovers from his accident."}

Only 11km (seven miles) from Mazar, the district is also home to the 209th Shaheen Corps, a 30,000-strong force meant to protect 114 districts across 10 provinces.\n\nAlthough the armed group's attack failed, it still caused major alarm for residents of one of Afghanistan's economic and cultural hubs.\n\nAbdul Wahab was on a business trip from Kabul when the news broke. He was immediately told to leave his well-guarded $77 a night hotel and stay in the homes of friends.\n\n\"The rich and powerful go there, of course, it will be targeted,\" his friends urged.\n\nHe spent last Tuesday night with his friends and then realised he had to get home to Kabul, in case the airport closed. Before its fall, the airport in the Western city of Herat was closed for several days as fighting reached the road leading to it.\n\nBy the following morning, thousands of others had the same idea. Not only did one-way ticket prices double to $150, but there were no tickets for several days. Luckily, Wahab had friends at a travel agency and was able to secure himself a ticket.\n\nBefore he could head to the airport though, he ran into another hurdle, finding cash to pay for the flight.\n\n\"The ATMs were all out of money, the banks were full of hundreds of people lining up trying to take out as much money as they could,\" Wahab said after returning to Kabul. Again, he had to turn to friends to borrow the money for the ticket until he could reach the capital.\n\nWhen he arrived at Maulana Jalaluddin Balkhi International Airport, though, it became evident that having a ticket was not a guarantee one could board a plane. He, and others who were trying to fly out at the height of the panic, described an overcrowded airport, teeming with clusters of hundreds of people at each step from the entrance to the security checks to the check-in desks and the departures terminal.\n\nPeople rush to the airport\n\nAva was at the airport with her mother, father and brother. The crowds were so large and the waiting halls so congested, the 21-year-old started to have panic attacks.\n\n\"It was hot and crowded. Everyone was shuffling around, I couldn't breathe,\" she said from her sister's home in Kabul. For Ava, her small frame and youth made it even more difficult to manoeuvre around the throngs of people.\n\nBoth Wahab and Ava recalled crowds of angry people trying to muscle through lines and concession stands.\n\n\"There was nothing left in the food stalls, people were there for hours trying to get food or water.\"\n\nFor Wahab, that meant waiting eight hours as his 4pm flight was changed and delayed until finally they left after midnight. The midnight flight itself was a special accommodation for the fact that there were back-to-back hourly flights, each one just as full as the other."}

Trump's account was also indefinitely disabled on Twitch, a US live and streaming service that belongs to Amazon.\n\nThe bans came as pro-Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol building in Washington DC. The riot interrupted a joint congressional session to confirm President-elect Joe Biden's election victory.\n\nWhat led to the ban?\n\nTrump posted a video on Twitter and Facebook more than two hours after protesters entered the Capitol and as authorities struggled to take control of the situation.\n\nTrump opened his video saying, \"I know your pain. I know your hurt. But you have to go home now.\"\n\nHe repeated claims of voter fraud in the video. He also appealed to his supporters, saying \"We don't want anybody hurt,\" adding: \"We can't play into the hands of these people.\"\n\nDirectly addressing his supporters in the video, he said: \"We love you, you're very special.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers and previous administration officials had reportedly begged Trump to call on his supporters to quell the violence.\n\n'This is the worst day for this country' To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nHow did Facebook respond?\n\nFacebook said it was \"indefinitely\" banning Trump's accounts, including on Instagram, according to a post by founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n\"Over the last several years, we have allowed President Trump to use our platform consistent with our own rules, at times removing content or labeling his posts when they violate our policies. We did this because we believe that the public has a right to the broadest possible access to political speech, even controversial speech.

The Twitter Safety account cited \"repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy.\"\n\nThe company required the removal of three of Trump's tweets, including the video, and warned: \"If the Tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked.\"\n\nTrump's account has since deleted those posts, Twitter said.\n\nIt said further violations of Twitter rules would result in permanent suspension."}

It created a traffic jam of more than 360 ships as of Sunday and is costing billions in delayed shipments.\n\nTeams of dredgers and tugboats were able to free the ship's stern on Sunday, moving 330 feet from the western bank. The bow was pulled loose today.\n\nWorkers were aided by high tides helped by a full moon. The full moon offers a spring tide, or king tide, in which high tides are higher and the low tides are lower because of the effects of gravity during a straight-line alignment of the Earth, the moon and the sun, USA TODAY reported.\n\nTugboats are pulling the Ever Given to the canal's Great Bitter Lake, where it will be inspected.\n\nHow did it happen?\n\nThe Ever Given was stuck near the Egyptian city of Suez, about 3.7 miles north of the canal's southern entrance. It was in a single-lane section of the canal, about 985 feet wide.\n\nIts owners originally said high winds in a sandstorm pushed the ship sideways, wedging it into both banks of the waterway. Containers stacked on deck may have acted as a sail.\n\nHowever, the chairman of Egypt's Suez Canal Authority said Saturday, without giving details, that weather conditions \"were not the main reasons\" for the grounding, and that \"there may have been technical or human reasons,\" the BBC reported. An investigation is ongoing.\n\nHow many ships are waiting?\n\nAt least 360 ships, carrying everything from cars to oil to grain, wait at the canal's northern and southern entrances. The AP said an analysis by data firm Refinitiv showed an additional 300 ships were en route to the canal over the next two weeks. Some ships have already diverted to the African route.\n\nCNN said the U.S. Navy offered dredging experts to assist.\n\nAuthorities originally disagree on how long the canal will be blocked. The ship's owner, Shoei Kisen, said its goal was to free the vessel by the night of March 27.\n\nAn Egyptian presidential adviser told Agence France Presse on March 26 that traffic would resume within 48 to 72 hours. However, the CEO of a dredging company has said the operation could take weeks.\n\nThe uncertainty has forced some shippers to alter course and take the longer, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa, adding weeks to their destinations and increasing fears of piracy. Some have contacted the U.S. Navy about increased security.\n\nOfficials were under great pressure to remove the ship.\n\nThe canal is a 120-mile-long shipping link between the Mediterranean and Red seas that carries 10% to 12% of commercial shipping and about 2.5% of the world's oil. A German insurer said delays could cost global trade $6 billion to $10 billion a week, Reuters reported.\n\nUSA TODAY said the blockage could worsen shipping delays and cause shortages of toilet paper, coffee and other goods.\n\nGlobalSecurity.org calls the canal \"strategically and economically one of the most important waterways in the world.\"\n\nWho owns the canal?\n\nThe Suez Canal is operated by Egypt, through its state-owned Suez Canal Authority. Canal revenue for Egypt was $5.6 billion in 2020, according to Arab News. On average, about 50 ships pass through the canal daily.\n\nThe canal took 10 years to build and opened in 1869. It's a sea-level canal, without locks, connecting major bodies of water at different altitudes. It normally takes a ship 13 to 15 hours to cross from one end to the other. It's been widened over the years, with the latest project in 2015 at a cost of $8 billion.\n\nThe Panama-flagged Ever Given was built in 2018 and is operated by Evergreen Marine of Taiwan. It can carry 20,000 20-foot containers, according to Reuters, and transports cargo between Asia and Europe. It has a crew of 25.\n\nThe 1,312-foot ship is often compared to the Empire State Building, which is 1,454 feet tall, including its spire and antenna."}

But other countries in Europe did poorly as well,\" said Cécile Viboud, an infectious diseases epidemiologist who has done a lot of research into deaths from the 1918 flu.\n\nWhether the Covid pandemic will qualify as the deadliest event in U.S. history is perhaps a question for Civil War historians. The long-accepted toll of the War Between the States was 620,000, which this pandemic has already surpassed. But in 2011, David Hacker, a historian at Binghamton University in New York State, published an article in the journal Civil War History arguing the true number of deaths in the Civil War was more likely around 750,000.\n\nThe heavy toll the pandemic has taken in the U.S. is due to the country's inadequate response early on, said Markel. David Morens, a medical historian at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed.\n\n\"I think it's generally known around the world that America didn't do a very good job in the early stages of controlling the pandemic,\" said Morens, who has also written extensively on the 1918 flu pandemic.\n\nComparing events that happened more than a century apart has its perils. For instance, the population of the United States in 1918 was a third of what it is now. So as a percentage of the national population, the Spanish flu deaths still has the lead on Covid-19.\n\nLikewise, the mean age of the people who died in 1918 was 28, whereas with Covid, deaths are occurring mainly in the elderly, said Viboud, who works at the National Institutes of Health's Fogerty International Center. In terms of cumulative years of life lost, the Spanish flu's impact thus remains greater.\n\nBut modern medicine is far more advanced than what was available in 1918. Now people whose lungs are under attack from Covid can be put on ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation — ECMO — machines, which pump oxygen into blood when a person's heart and lungs are no longer up to the job. These were not options in 1918.\n\nAnd for months now, the country has had vaccines that are highly effective at lowering the risk of dying from Covid. Still the fatalities pile up, though at a slower rate than earlier in the pandemic."}

The unprecedented weather left 210 people dead and led to more than $50 billion in damages, prompting the Biden Administration to declare a national disaster in the state.\n\nIn the aftermath, many residents also faced a slew of billing and insurance issues, causing some to be saddled with astronomical electric bills of upwards of $1,000 a day because their plans were tied to wholesale rates.\n\n\"Winter Storm Uri highlighted the vulnerabilities of our electricity and natural gas systems during long duration, widespread cold-weather conditions,\" Mark Olson, NERC's manager of reliability assessments, said in a press statement. \"The industry has taken major steps to prepare for extreme weather conditions this winter, but our existing generation fleet and fuel infrastructure remain exposed in many areas.\"\n\nTo further mitigate outages, NERC said power companies should take proactive measures to prepare for extreme winter weather, including implementing emergency operating plans, conducting drills, and polling generators for fuel and availability status.\n\n\"To be resilient in extreme weather, we are counting on our grid operators to proactively monitor the generation fleet, adjust operating plans and keep the lines of communication open,\" Olson said in the press statement.\n\nAccording to News 4 San Antonio, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas — the company that operates the Texas power grid — plans to inspect 300 power plants during the course of 21 days in December in an effort to prevent power outages.\n\n\"To see what could happen under extreme cases in ERCOT, I think is very disappointing and something that we need to see how we can rectify,\" John Moura, NERC's director of reliability assessment, told News 4."}

Trump from their platforms after the Capitol riot in January, he lost direct access to his most powerful megaphones. On Friday, Facebook said the former president would not be allowed back on its service until at least January 2023, citing a risk to public safety.\n\nSince his ban and President Biden's inauguration, he has posted statements online far less often. But some of his statements have traveled just as far and wide on social networks.\n\nThe reach of Trump's words before and after his ban from social media Each circle represents a statement made by Mr. Trump. The size of a circle is determined by the number of likes and shares the statement generated across Twitter, Instagram and Facebook on posts quoting it, including on Mr. Trump's own account before he was banned. Tallies of likes and shares come from the 100 most highly liked and shared posts on Facebook and Instagram for each Trump statement. (In most cases, there were fewer than 100 posts quoting each statement.) On Twitter, any posts quoting a given Trump statement that had at least 10 retweets were included.\n\nThe New York Times examined Mr. Trump's nearly 1,600 social media posts from Sept. 1 to Jan. 8, the day Mr. Trump was banned from the platforms. We then tracked the social media engagement with the dozens of written statements he made on his personal website, campaign fund-raising site and in email blasts from Jan. 9 until May 5, which was the day that the Facebook Oversight Board, which reviews some content decisions by the company, said that the company acted appropriately in kicking him off the service.\n\nBefore the ban, the social media post with the median engagement generated 272,000 likes and shares. After the ban, that dropped to 36,000 likes and shares. Yet 11 of his 89 statements after the ban attracted as many likes or shares as the median post before the ban, if not more.\n\nHow does that happen?\n\nMr. Trump had long been his own best promoter on social media. The vast majority of people on Twitter and Facebook interacted directly with Mr. Trump's posts, either liking or sharing them, The Times analysis found.\n\nBut after the ban, other popular social media accounts often picked up his messages and posted them themselves. (Last week, Mr. Trump shut down his blog, one of the places he made statements.)\n\nOn Oct. 8, Mr. Trump tweeted that the then-Democratic presidential candidate Joseph R.

The statement was liked and shared more than 661,000 times.\n\nThe Global Disinformation Index, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies disinformation, examined the political leanings of the top accounts sharing Mr. Trump's statements online after he was barred from Facebook and Twitter. The group classified hundreds of accounts as either left- or right-leaning, or a mix of the two, relying on standards that it established through its work on disinformation risk ratings for news sites and other online media.\n\nOne thing that became immediately clear: Mr. Trump's most ardent supporters continue to spread his message — doing the work that he had been unable to do himself.\n\nThe top sharers of the March post included the right-wing publication Breitbart News (159,500 likes and shares), a Facebook page called \"President Donald Trump Fan Club\" (48,200 likes), Fox News (42,000 likes), and Jenna Ellis (36,700 likes), a lawyer who made regular television appearances as Mr. Trump's proxy to trumpet his debunked claims of a rigged election.\n\nBut when Mr. Trump criticizes conservatives, his remarks sometimes get picked up by both the left and right.\n\nOn Feb. 16, for instance, Mr. Trump derided Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, because of Mr. McConnell's unwillingness to back Mr. Trump's attempts to undermine the 2020 election."}

The other 5% was financed by the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, according to their website.\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan announced they were stepping down from their duties as senior royals, they said they wanted to achieve financial independence from Prince Harry's family.\n\nAlso known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan clearly found a way to maintain their lifestyle. In June 2020, they purchased a $14.7 million Montecito, California, estate for themselves and their children: Archie, born May 6, 2019, in London, and Lilibet Diana, born June 4, 2021, in Santa Barbara, California.\n\nThey are also responsible for their own personal security, which Forbes estimated could cost as much as $3 million annually.\n\nHere's a look at the pair's current net worths and sources of income as they pursue their independence.\n\nHarry and Meghan Net Worth\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of their move from Great Britain, the couple relied on the $13 million trust Prince Harry inherited from the estate of his mother, Princess Diana, who died in a 1997 car crash. Harry received the bulk of the money after his 30th birthday in September 2014.\n\nIn addition, Markle contributed $2 million from her work in TV and films, Forbes reported. She played Rachel Zane on 108 episodes of the television series \"Suits,\" leaving the cast in 2018 before her marriage to Harry.\n\n\"I've got what my mum left me, and without that, we would not have been able to do this,\" Harry told Oprah Winfrey in a March 2021 interview.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe current net worth of the Sussexes is not exactly known, but it continues to grow as they sign lucrative contracts in the entertainment industry.\n\nIn September 2020, the Duke and Duchess signed a multiyear, $100 million contract with Netflix to produce documentaries, docuseries, feature films, scripted shows and children's programming.\n\n\"Our lives, both independent of each other and as a couple, have allowed us to understand the power of the human spirit: of courage, resilience, and the need for connection,\" the couple said in a statement. \"Through our work with diverse communities and their environments, to shining a light on people and causes around the world, our focus will be on creating content that informs but also gives hope.\"\n\nIn April 2021, Harry and Meghan announced the first Netflix project from their production house, Archewell Productions. Titled \"Heart of Invictus,\" the multi-episode series will look at the training of Invictus Games competitors as they prepare for the athletic competition in 2022.\n\nThe Invictus Game Foundation, started in 2014 with Prince Harry as the \"founding patron,\" gives people who have experience \"life-changing injuries or illnesses\" because of their military service a chance to take part in the Olympics-style competition. A release date hasn't been set.\n\nIn December 2020, Prince Harry and his wife expanded their media brand by announcing a partnership with Spotify. The couple plan to produce podcasts through their Archewell Audio arm that both uplift and entertain.\n\nWhile contract terms were not announced, the deal could be worth as much as $35 million, one industry expert told Newsweek."}

Andrew Cuomo, looks worse in hindsight as the governor's administration is questioned about its role in failing to disclose the true number of COVID-19 nursing home deaths.\n\nCNN is covering that story, but not on Chris Cuomo's show. The network said it had reinstated a prohibition on Cuomo interviewing or doing stories about his brother that it had temporarily lifted last spring.\n\nThe brothers were both in the spotlight last March. Chris Cuomo caught COVID-19 and continued anchoring his show from his basement, while the governor dealt with New York's hellish days as the nation's early coronavirus epicenter. Andrew Cuomo's near-daily briefing was widely televised and, to some viewers, embraced as a counterpoint to those held by former President Donald Trump.\n\nNine times between March 19 and June 24, 2020, the governor appeared on his brother's show. The trash-talking and brotherly love between the two Italians from Queens was fun if occasionally cheesy, like when Chris Cuomo mocked his brother's big nose with a giant cotton swab he said would be necessary to give him a COVID-19 test.\n\n\"I found these interviews to be very entertaining, and perhaps Chris could ask questions of his brother that other people can't,\" said Roy Gutterman, a media law professor at Syracuse University. \"But from the very beginning, I thought it was wildly inappropriate.\n\n\"It's Journalism 101,\" he said. \"We tell our students you shouldn't interview your family and friends.\"\n\nThe policy avoids a conflict of interest — can one brother really be expected to ask tough questions of another? — or at the very least the appearance of one.\n\nThrough a spokeswoman, CNN said that the early months of the pandemic were an extraordinary time.\n\n\"We felt that Chris speaking with his brother about the challenges of what millions of American families were struggling with was of significant human interest,\" CNN said. \"As a result, we made an exception to a rule that we have had in place since 2013 which prevents Chris from interviewing his brother, and that rule remains in place today.\""}

In Brazil, the messaging service is by far the most widely used app in the country, installed on 99% of smartphones, according to tech pollster Mobile Time.\n\nWhatsApp has become essential in Brazil to communicate with friends and family, as well as for a variety of other tasks, such as ordering food. Offices, various services and even the courts had trouble making appointments, and phone lines became overwhelmed.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Haitians in their homeland and abroad fretted over the WhatsApp outage.\n\nMany of the country's more than 11 million people depend it to alert one another about gang violence in particular neighborhoods or to talk to relatives in the U.S. about money transfers and other important matters. Haitian migrants traveling to the U.S. rely on it to find each other or share key information such as safe places to sleep.\n\nNelzy Mireille, a 35-year-old unemployed woman who depends on money sent from relatives abroad, said she stopped at a repair shop in the capital of Port-au-Prince because she thought her phone was malfunctioning.\n\n\"I was waiting on confirmation on a money transfer from my cousin,\" she said. \"I was so frustrated.\"\n\n\"I was not able to hear from my love,\" complained 28-year-old Wilkens Bourgogne, referring to his partner, who was in the neighboring Dominican Republic, buying goods to bring back to Haiti.

If there had been an emergency such as shelling that he needed to warn field workers about, there could have been major problems, he said.\n\n\"Luckily this didn't happen yesterday during the outage,\" he said.\n\nBut hospitals treating COVID-19 patients in the region were thrown into panic. They lost contact with oxygen suppliers who have no fixed location and are normally reached via WhatsApp. One hospital sent staff member searching for oxygen at nearly two dozen facilities, said Dr. Fadi Hakim of the Syrian American Medical Society.\n\nIn Lima, Peru, the breakdown complicated dental technician Mary Mejia's job.

PE's pipeline purchases\n\nOn the first Friday in May, a gang of black-hat hackers operating under the ominous nom de guerre of DarkSide successfully breached the cyber defenses of Colonial Pipeline, a company that moves 100 million gallons of fuel a day through a 5,500-mile network of pipes running across the eastern half of the U.S.\n\nColonial's system went dark for several days, prompting panic buying and gasoline shortages up and down the East Coast. Operations resumed in earnest on Wednesday, but only after Colonial reportedly paid the criminals a ransom of nearly $5 million in bitcoin to regain access to its systems. No immense damage was ultimately done. But the saga was a dramatic example of the rise in frequency of such ransomware attacks across the corporate world—not to mention a pointed reminder of just how vulnerable some of our crucial infrastructure remains.\n\nIt is also a tale with ties to private equity. Back in 2010, industry powerhouse KKR acquired a 23.4% stake in Colonial Pipeline for $1.1 billion, investing jointly alongside the National Pension Service of Korea. A year later, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec—a Canadian pension fund that frequently does private equity-style deals—acquired a 16.6% stake of its own in Colonial.\n\nPrivate equity investment in the larger energy sector has been tailing off in recent years, but investments in pipeline operators and other midstream energy companies have long held a place in the industry landscape. The thesis is relatively simple. The global demand for energy continues to grow, and somebody needs to build and operate the assets to move all that energy around. Pipeline companies often ink long-term contracts that lock in fees for years to come, creating a steady and projectable stream of cash flow for investors.\n\nDuring the 2010s, PE firms averaged about 17 investments per year in oil and gas pipeline companies based in the U.S., according to PitchBook data. But activity in the space plunged last year, when the pandemic created chaos across the energy sector—chaos best demonstrated when the futures price of West Texas Intermediate crude dipped into negative territory last April. After conducting 17 pipeline deals with a combined value of $7.2 billion in 2019, private equity firms executed a mere $600 million worth of transactions last year.\n\nOver the past few years, KKR has been a particularly busy player in the pipeline space. In 2018, the firm formed a joint venture with energy company Williams to buy Discovery Midstream for $1.2 billion. A year later, it paid $385 million for a 49% stake in a midstream joint venture with SemGroup. That same year, KKR agreed to buy a 65% stake in the Coastal GasLink Pipeline project in western Canada, a controversial development that has sparked protests and condemnation from First Nations people in the region."}

How lucky are you?\n\nChris Cuomo: I consider myself blessed to have you in my life on and off the TV. I do think it is fundamentally dishonest of us to not tell people how completely random this moment is on TV each night. It has never been given a name until now. It has never been produced, and it has only been discouraged. But, everybody talks to us about it and now here we are with our own podcast!\n\nDon Lemon: Honestly, Chris, we're fearless in those moments because we are really vulnerable.

A lot of couples that you see on news shows, they are friendly for the purpose of the show, and that's neither good nor bad. It is not the case with us.\n\nDon Lemon: What's been most interesting to me is that I've always been friends with people who are different than me. And you have the same sort of thing. All of your friends that I know, they don't really look like you. They don't really act like you. They come from different backgrounds and the same thing for me.\n\nChris Cuomo: We both have been doing this a long time and I've worked with plenty of people that I've liked but I've never spent as much time off television with somebody as you and I do together and there's a real treat in that.\n\nUnless something really crazy happens in the next 10, 15 years, I think this is the most interesting and recordable part of our professional lives.

If the court follows standard practice and the alternates are the last three chosen, the 12 who deliberate would be evenly split between white people and people of colour. Opening statements are to begin Monday.\n\n\"It's a small step in the right direction,\" said Trahern Crews, an organizer and spokesperson for Black Lives Matter in Minnesota. African Americans bring \"an institutional memory of the police\" to jury rooms that white people and even other people of colour don't share, he said.\n\nBlacks underrepresented in county's jury pool\n\nIt's very rare to seat such a mixed jury in Minnesota, said Mary Moriarty, a former chief public defender for Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis.\n\nThat's important because she said they'll bring a \"very different lens\" to their deliberations, though she said it's a mistake to think people of colour all view things the same.\n\nCourt records obtained by Moriarty show Black people are chronically underrepresented on juries in Hennepin County, which is 74 per cent white and 14 per cent Black.\n\nThe jury pool in 2019 — created from lists of people with driver's licences or state ID cards, as well as voter registration lists — was 79 per cent white and eight per cent Black. People not on the lists don't get summoned.\n\nScholars, courts and legal groups have increasingly advocated for greater jury diversity — not just by race, but by gender and socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nExperts say when jurors share the same background, they're less likely to question their own biases and preconceptions heading into deliberations.\n\nThey also say jurors from different backgrounds may evaluate witnesses differently, including how much weight to give their testimony.\n\nChauvin charged with murder, manslaughter\n\nDerek Chauvin is charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death on May 25, 2020.\n\nFloyd, a Black man, was declared dead after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for about nine minutes while he was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn't breathe.\n\nThe widely seen video set off street protests in Minneapolis, some violent, that spread across the U.S. and the world.\n\nIt's rare for police officers to stand trial for fatal shootings. When they do, recent history suggests a more diverse jury increases the odds for conviction, although the record is mixed.\n\nIn Minnesota in 2017, the jury that acquitted suburban police officer Jeronimo Yanez, a Latino man, of second-degree manslaughter in the 2016 shooting death of Philando Castile, a Black man, included 10 white people and two Black people.\n\nThe jury that convicted Black Minneapolis officer Mohamed Noor, a Somali American, in 2019 of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the shooting death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a white Australian woman, included six people of colour, including two Filipino men, an Ethiopian man and a Pakistani woman."}

Cuomo announced today that all healthcare workers in New York State, including staff at hospitals and long-term care facilities (LTCF), including nursing homes, adult care, and other congregate care settings, will be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by Monday, September 27. The State Department of Health will issue Section 16 Orders requiring all hospital, LTCF, and nursing homes to develop and implement a policy mandating employee vaccinations, with limited exceptions for those with religious or medical reasons. To date, 75% of the state's ~450,000 hospital workers, 74% of the state's ~30,000 adult care facility workers, and 68% of the state's ~145,500 nursing home workers have completed their vaccine series. Lt. Governor Kathy Hochul's administration was briefed prior to the announcement.\n\n\"When COVID ambushed New York last year, New Yorkers acted, while the Federal Government denied the problem,\" Governor Cuomo said. \"Now, the Delta variant is spreading across the nation and across New York -- new daily positives are up over 1000% over the last six weeks, and over 80 percent of recent positives in New York State are linked to the Delta variant. We must now act again to stop the spread. Our healthcare heroes led the battle against the virus, and now we need them to lead the battle between the variant and the vaccine. We have always followed the science, and we're doing so again today, with these recommendations by Dr. Zucker and federal and state health experts. But we need to do more. I have strongly urged private businesses to implement vaccinated-only admission policies, and school districts to mandate vaccinations for teachers. Neither will occur without the state legally mandating the actions -- private businesses will not enforce a vaccine mandate unless it's the law, and local school districts will be hesitant to make these challenging decisions without legal direction.\"\n\nGovernor Cuomo also announced that the Department of Health has authorized a third COVID-19 vaccine dose for New Yorkers with compromised immune systems, following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation last week. Eligible New Yorkers can receive their third dose 28 days after the completion of their two-dose vaccine series, effective immediately.\n\nThe CDC is currently recommending that moderately to severely immunocompromised people receive an additional dose, including people who have:\n\nBeen receiving active cancer treatment for tumors or cancers of the blood;\n\nReceived an organ transplant and are taking medications to suppress the immune system;\n\nReceived a stem cell transplant within the last 2 years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system;\n\nModerate or severe primary immunodeficiency (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome);\n\nAdvanced or untreated HIV infection;\n\nActive treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, cancer chemotherapy that causes severe immunosuppression, or other medications that may suppress your immune response."}

At the entrances to the building, there were a few Capitol Police officers helplessly trying to hold a line at the doors, but they were vastly outnumbered. The officers had somehow gotten the doors back closed, but within minutes, rioters were easily pushing past them again. Once I was inside, too, I saw no officers at all for a stretch, as rioters plundered and destroyed furniture. When I did, it was even more surreal: They looked as if they were there loitering themselves. Some were equipped with riot gear, others not, but most just stood there and watched. Some rioters stopped to ask them for directions. In one of the only direct interactions I saw, a Capitol officer asked a rioter to put out a cigarette, then walked away.\n\nI'd never seen law enforcement show this level of restraint at any protest, much less a riot. And now we know why. A damning new report by the Capitol Police's own inspector general, Michael A. Bolton, presented at a Capitol Hill hearing today, portrays a police force that recklessly disregarded intelligence and hobbled its own response at every turn.\n\nWith around 140 officers injured and one dead, there was some passing of the buck in the immediate aftermath of the riot. Republicans were in denial. The former Capitol Police chief, Steven Sund, resigned almost immediately. He wrote in a letter, \"Perfect hindsight does not change the fact that nothing in our collective experience or our intelligence—Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and D.C. Metropolitan Police (MPD)—indicated that a well-coordinated, armed assault on the Capitol might occur on Jan. 6.\" Sund repeated this assertion in testimony in front of a U.S. Senate committee just weeks ago: \"None of the intelligence we received predicted what actually occurred,\" he said.\n\nThat account stands in direct contrast to the new report, in which Bolton found that Capitol Police leadership dismissed threat assessments and forbade rank-and-file officers from appropriately responding to the threat. The New York Times reviewed a copy of the document and reported that the Capitol Police's own intelligence warned three days before that \"Congress itself is the target on the 6th.\" There were warnings about who would be in the crowd: \"Stop the Steal's propensity to attract white supremacists, militia members and others who actively promote violence may lead to a significantly dangerous situation for law enforcement and the general public alike.\" Bolton's report also unearthed pre-insurrection warnings from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, which had relayed to the Capitol Police that a map of the Capitol's tunnel system had turned up on pro-Trump message boards.\n\nBut the 104-page report found that, rather than ramp up security, the officers on duty were ordered to carry only limited riot-prevention equipment and to not carry stun grenades. Bolton wrote that \"heavier less-lethal weapons were not used that day because of orders from leadership.\" He added that the unit was \"operating at a decreased level of readiness as a result of a lack of standards for equipment\" that diminished \"operational readiness.\""}

In February, the Republican-led Senate voted not to remove him from office. After that, impeachment mostly disappeared from national discourse, barely playing a role in the presidential election, even though it was a historic moment and the idea was stunningly popular, and even though it involved Trump's attempt to scuttle the campaign of Joe Biden, who ended up as the Democratic presidential nominee. But views on Trump were already largely ossified, and besides, there was the pandemic and an economic crisis to deal with.\n\nThe memory of impeachment is back with a vengeance this week. Though Biden beat Trump, the president continues to try to overturn Biden's victory. In a phone call on Saturday that was eerily reminiscent of Trump's July 2019 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump tried to pressure Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of Georgia (the state, not the country) to do something, anything, to throw the state's results back to him.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump won't just violate the rules again—he's already doing it\n\nDuring impeachment, Trump's critics, including me, warned repeatedly that if he were not impeached and removed, he'd feel empowered to commit the same offenses again. Trump's current, shambling coup attempt is the price of the Senate's failure to remove him.\n\nRaffensperger, who seems understandably furious over Trump's pressure campaign against him, taped the conversation and then released it to The Washington Post after Trump lied about it on Twitter. The president's MO has not changed since July 2019—in fact, it has scarcely changed over the course of his career. All the hallmarks of the Zelensky call popped up in the Saturday coup call. Trump alternates between wheedling flattery and domineering (though vague) threats. He suggests that Raffensperger owes him one—aren't they on the same team? He presents a proposed miscarriage of justice as a vindication of justice. Just as he did with Zelensky, Trump runs through a litany of wild and false conspiracy theories.\n\nTrump speaks like a mob boss, making his desire clear but never saying explicitly what he wants, so as to maintain deniability. What he says is, \"So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break.\" What he means is, Find some way to throw out valid votes so that I can win. (Never mind that the state's results have been certified and its electors seated; Raffensperger's role has concluded.)"}

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current vaccines protect people well against all the common variants.\n\nDuring a company earnings call on Wednesday morning, Dr. Mikael Dolsten, who leads worldwide research, development and medical for Pfizer, called the new data on a third dose of vaccine \"encouraging.\"\n\n\"Receiving a third dose more than six months after vaccination, when protection may be beginning to wane, was estimated to potentially boost the neutralizing antibody titers in participants in this study to up to 100 times higher post-dose three compared to pre-dose three,\" Dolsten said in prepared remarks. \"These preliminary data are very encouraging as Delta continues to spread.\"\n\nThe data also show that antibody levels are much higher against the original coronavirus variant and the Beta variant, first identified in South Africa, after a third dose.\n\nSeparately, Pfizer and its partner BioNtech released new safety and efficacy data for their coronavirus vaccine Wednesday, and said it shows protection holds up for at least six months, although it may start to wane slightly towards the end of that time.\n\nThe pre-print paper, posted Wednesday to the online server medrxiv.org, updates results from Pfizer's trial involving 44,000 volunteers around the world.\n\nIt found the overall efficacy was about 91% during the six months. Vaccine efficacy against severe Covid-19 was about 97%, the data show. The paper has not yet been peer-reviewed nor published in a journal.\n\nThe data show that the vaccine's efficacy peaked at more than 96% from a week to around two months after receiving a second dose of vaccine, and then appeared to gradually decline to 83.7% four to six months later, with an average decline of about 6% over the last two months.\n\nEarlier this month, Pfizer announced it has seen waning immunity from its coronavirus vaccine, saying it is picking up its efforts to develop a third dose that will protect people from variants. The company also specified it would seek emergency use authorization under the US Food and Drug Administration for a third dose in August.\n\nBut in an unusual move, the FDA and CDC said at the time Americans don't need third doses quite yet and that it was not up to companies alone to decide when an additional dose might be needed.\n\nUS Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy repeated that point Wednesday morning, telling CNN's Poppy Harlow, \"People do not need to go out and get a booster shot.\""}

Eric Swalwell, who served as a House manager in Donald Trump's last impeachment trial, filed a lawsuit Friday against the former president, his son, lawyer and a Republican congressman whose actions he charges led to January's insurrection.\n\nThe California Democrat's suit, filed in federal court in Washington, alleges a conspiracy to violate civil rights, along with negligence, inciting a riot and inflicting emotional distress. It follows a similar suit filed by Rep. Bennie Thompson last month in an attempt to hold the former president accountable in some way for his actions Jan. 6, following his Senate acquittal.\n\nSwalwell charges that Trump, his son Donald Jr., along with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, had made \"false and incendiary allegations of fraud and theft, and in direct response to the Defendant's express calls for violence at the rally, a violent mob attacked the U.S. Capitol.\"\n\nThe lawsuit spells out in detail how the Trumps, Giuliani and Brooks spread baseless claims of election fraud, both before and after the 2020 presidential election was declared, and charges that they helped to spin up the thousands of rioters before they stormed the Capitol. Five people died as a result of the violence on Jan. 6, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer.\n\nTrump's spokesman Jason Miller called Swalwell a \"low-life\" with \"no credibility.\"\n\n\"Now, after failing miserably with two impeachment hoaxes,\" Swalwell is attacking \"our greatest President with yet another witch hunt,\" Miller said in a statement. \"It's a disgrace that a compromised Member of Congress like Swalwell still sits on the House Intelligence Committee.\"\n\nBrooks said the lawsuit was frivolous and \"a meritless ploy.\"\n\n\"I make no apologies whatsoever for fighting for accurate and honest elections,\" he said, adding he wore the lawsuit \"like a badge of courage.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, through Trump's own words, accuses the former president of inciting the riot, using much of the same playbook used by Swalwell and others during Trump's impeachment trial — that his lies over the election results stirred supporters into the false belief the 2020 election had been stolen, that he egged the angry mob on through his rally speech and that he did nothing when faced with the images of throngs of his supporters smashing windows at the U.S. Capitol and sending lawmakers fleeing.\n\n\"Those with knowledge claimed that during this moment of national horror, Trump was 'delighted' and was 'confused about why other people on his team weren't as excited as he was.' Others described Trump as 'borderline enthusiastic' about the unfolding violence,\" according to the suit.\n\nUnlike Thompson's lawsuit — filed against Trump, Giuliani and some far-right extremist groups whose members are alleged to have participated in the insurrection — Swalwell's did not specify whether he was filing in his personal or official capacity, which would require additional approvals from the House and involve House attorneys.\n\nBoth lawsuits cite a federal civil rights law that was enacted to counter the Ku Klux Klan's intimidation of officials. Swalwell's attorney Philip Andonian praised Thompson's lawsuit, filed under a Reconstruction-era law called the Ku Klux Klan Act, and said they were behind it 100%, but saw the need for this one, too.\n\n\"We see ourselves as having a different angle to this, holding Trump accountable for the incitement, the disinformation,\" he said.\n\nPresidents are historically afforded broad immunity from lawsuits for actions they take in their role as commander in chief. But the lawsuit, like the one by Thompson, was brought against Trump in his personal, not official, capacity.\n\nSwalwell also describes in detail being trapped in the House chamber with many other members of Congress as plainclothes Capitol Police officers barricaded the doors and tried to fend off the mob at gunpoint.\n\n\"Fearing for their lives, the Plaintiff and others masked their identities as members of Congress, texted loved ones in case the worst happened, and took shelter throughout the Capitol complex,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Brooks \"conspired with the other Defendants to undermine the election results by alleging, without evidence, that the election had been rigged and by pressuring elected officials, courts, and ultimately Congress to reject the results.\" It notes that he spoke at a rally supporting Trump at the Ellipse, near the White House, shortly before thousands of pro-Trump rioters made their way to the Capitol and overwhelmed police officers to shove their way inside the building.\n\nThe suit seeks unspecified damages, and Swalwell also wants a court to order all of the defendants to provide written notice to him a week before they plan to have a rally in Washington that would draw more than 50 people."}

But it will be two months before the former Minneapolis police officer learns his sentence for George Floyd's death.\n\nChauvin, 45, was convicted Tuesday of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for 9 1/2 minutes as the Black man said he couldn't breathe.\n\nEven though he was found guilty of three counts, under Minnesota statutes he'll only be sentenced on the most serious one — second-degree murder. While that count carries a maximum sentence of 40 years, experts say he won't get that much. They say that for all practical purposes, the maximum he would face is 30 years, and he could get less.\n\nHere's a breakdown on Minnesota's sentencing nuances:\n\nWHY WON'T WE SEE MULTIPLE SENTENCES?\n\nBecause all the charges stem from one act, carried out against one person. Multiple sentences are typically handed down in cases when there are convictions for multiple victims, or multiple crimes against one victim.\n\nFor example, if a defendant is convicted of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a woman — two crimes against one victim — a judge would issue a sentence on each count, and could rule that they be served at the same time or consecutively, said former Hennepin County chief public defender Mary Moriarty.\n\nThat's not the case here, Moriarty said. \"This case involved three different theories of the same behavior toward the same person.\"\n\nIS THERE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS?\n\nIn another high-profile murder case involving a Minneapolis officer, Mohamed Noor was convicted of third-degree murder and manslaughter in the 2017 shooting death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond. Noor was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison on the third-degree murder conviction, but no penalty was issued for manslaughter.\n\nIf Noor's murder charge is tossed out on appeal, which is pending, he would then be sentenced on that lesser count. Likewise, if Chauvin's second-degree murder count is ultimately dismissed, he would be brought back to court for resentencing on the top remaining charge.\n\nWHY IS IT UNLIKELY CHAUVIN WILL GET THE 40-YEAR MAX?\n\nMinnesota has sentencing guidelines that were created to establish rational, consistent sentences and ensure sentences are neutral without considering factors such as race or gender. The guidelines say that even though they are advisory, presumptive sentences \"are deemed appropriate\" and judges should only depart from them when \"substantial and compelling circumstances can be identified and articulated.\"\n\nFor second-degree unintentional murder, guidelines say the presumptive sentence for someone with no criminal record like Chauvin would be 12 1/2 years. Judges can sentence someone to as little as 10 years and eight months or as much as 15 years and still be within the advisory guideline range.\n\nBut in this case, prosecutors are seeking a sentence that goes above the guideline range, called an \"upward departure.\" They cited several aggravating factors, including that Floyd was particularly vulnerable, that Chauvin was a uniformed officer acting in a position of authority, and that his crime was witnessed by multiple children — including a 9-year-old girl who testified that watching the restraint made her \"sad and kind of mad.\"\n\nAfter the verdicts, Attorney General Keith Ellison said: \"We believe there are aggravating factors and the sentence should exceed the sentencing guidelines.\"\n\nSO WHAT'S REALISTIC?"}

Tuesday was the coldest day in North Texas in 72 years, with the Dallas-Fort Worth area reaching a record low temperature of minus 2 degrees Fahrenheit this week.\n\nThe cold weather has triggered a wave of blackouts across Texas, leaving millions of residents shivering in the dark. In some places, Texans have been without power for days.\n\nPublic officials and utility customers want to know why the Texas power grid wasn't better prepared. And to get ahead of the next extreme event like this, it's also important to ask what the chances are of something like this happening again.\n\nWith average temperatures rising around the world due to greenhouse gas emissions, there is more heat in the global climate system. That's already having some predictable impacts, like an increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves.\n\nBut it may be having some counterintuitive effects as well, especially during colder seasons. How climate change will reshape winters is, as scientists like to say, an area of active research.\n\nThere are a couple of competing ideas for how more warming will change the likelihood of extreme cold periods, like the frigid weather currently gripping much of the US. One group of researchers says that warming will make such events less likely, while another says that warming in the Arctic will increase the chances of frigid polar air spilling further south, leading to more periods of extreme cold in the near term.\n\n\"I would say it's still pretty controversial and it has been for quite a while,\" said Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nBut as Texas shows, failing to prepare for winter weather extremes can be devastating, so it's critical to find out what scenarios could be in store and how often they'll occur.\n\nHow an episode of warming in the stratosphere above the Arctic led to a chill in Texas\n\nJust like heat waves in the summer, a prolonged drop in temperature in the winter is a distinct meteorological phenomenon. The American Meteorological Society defines a \"cold wave\" as \"a rapid fall in temperature within 24 hours to temperatures requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture, industry, commerce, and social activities.\"\n\nAnd like heat waves, what counts as a cold wave depends on the local climate. The temperature threshold for a cold snap in Alaska is much lower than that for Arkansas."}

But it was far from done.\n\nIda then spun north, retaining plenty of punch to flood New York's subway system, kick up seven tornadoes in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and turn inland Philadelphia's freeways into canals. Ida cost $65 billion, according to some measures, and 115 lives; including 50 deaths in the less-suspecting Northeast alone. The property damage made it the most expensive natural disaster of 2021. Floods in Europe came second at $43 billion.\n\nIn all, the top 10 natural disasters totaled at least $170 billion, according to insurance data, news reports and other sources compiled by U.K. nonprofit Christian Aid.\n\nDon't miss: Wall Street could crumble under the weight of a 'carbon bubble,' these groups warn\n\nThis year marked a 13% rise in financial costs from global natural disasters over 2020. The Christian Aid report, which is compiled each year, largely tracks insured costs and may not account for all economic loss.\n\nNotably, 2021 kicked off with an oddity.\n\nTypically temperate Texas suffered under a February ice storm that strained its wind- and natural gas-powered independent electric utility. Citizens hunkered down in darkened, freezing homes — at least those lucky enough to have shelter. More than 111 people died in the state, largely from hypothermia. The financial toll topped $20 billion, based on insurance data. Local reports said the overall impact could have reached $200 billion.\n\nRead: Texas and Midwest U.S. at risk of winter blackouts again if another deep freeze hits, watchdog warns\n\nSource: Christian Aid, using Aon and Swiss Re insurance figures, World Weather Attribution, Reuters, and other nonprofits and news outlets.\n\nIda's cost, the number of states impacted and its push inland made it memorable. But it was just one storm within another Atlantic hurricane season that quickly blew through the list of given names that are historically used to distinguish the events. It's the first time hurricane forecasters have used up the World Meteorological Organization's initial list of names in two consecutive years: 2020 and 2021.\n\nSteve Bowen, meteorologist and head of catastrophe insight at insurer Aon, said 2021 is expected to be the sixth time that global natural catastrophes have crossed the $100 billion insured loss threshold. All six times took place since 2011, and 2021 will be the fourth in five years.\n\nIn its own assessment issued earlier in December, the globe's largest reinsurer, Swiss Re, estimated that natural catastrophes and extreme weather events caused around $250 billion in damage over the past year. That marked a 24% increase over last year. The cost to the insurance industry alone was the fourth highest since 1970, Swiss Re said.\n\nRead: It's got Leo and Meryl and the return of Jennifer Lawrence: 'Don't Look Up' is the darkly comedic climate-change film that doesn't mention climate change\n\nNatural disasters are not new, of course, but their frequency, intensity and their cost in property damage to both developed and developing nations as population numbers rise and cluster in cities and on coasts has been increasingly linked to climate change.\n\nFor instance, warming oceans mean that hurricanes suck up and carry more water deeper inland and for longer, bringing devastating flooding. To the benefit of citizens and buildings, construction and warning systems have improved.

How could a banking giant make a blunder of such staggering magnitude despite multiple checks and balances? So what exactly went wrong here?\n\nI recently circled back to that story and realized that it was, unsurprisingly, more complicated than it had sounded at first blush. Nevertheless, as software developers and software users, I suspected we could learn quite a bit from this expensive mistake along with our customers.\n\nI want to unpack a few of those lessons—but first, let's review what happened.\n\nICYMI: What Happened in the Citibank Wire Transfer Case\n\nThe bare-bones version of the story goes like this: Citibank, acting as the administrative agent for Revlon's loan, meant to process $7.8 million in interest payments to Revlon's lenders. However, Citibank's software system required that it set up and execute what was, in effect, a \"dummy\" transaction to process the interest payment. Citibank would create a transfer of the entire outstanding balance, including both principal and interest, into an internally held \"wash account.\" Citibank's staff had to check not just one clearly labeled box but also two other boxes with cryptic and confusing labels to direct the funds to the internal account. Because they only checked the one box, the money, totaling about $900 billion, didn't go to the wash account—it was wired straight to the creditors. (A rather large oops!)\n\nCitibank realized its error within 24 hours and asked the lenders to return the mistakenly transferred money. Some did, but several lenders refused due to a strange quirk of New York law: the \"discharge-for-value\" exception. This defense applies when someone receives a payment that is, in fact, owed to them. That recipient can keep mistakenly sent funds so long as\n\nthe recipient did not fraudulently induce the payment and\n\nthe recipient did not realize at the time of receipt that the money was sent by mistake.\n\nCitibank filed a lawsuit to recover the unreturned funds, which totaled about $500 million. Most of the facts in the litigation were simple. First, Revlon did owe its creditors, though the total amount was not due until 2023. Second, the payments the lenders received were correct payoff amounts, down to the penny. Third, the lenders—who weren't even expecting payments—did nothing to induce the payoff. So the only real question for the court was whether the lenders immediately realized that Citibank made a mistake when it sent the payments.\n\n...the only real question for the court was whether the lenders immediately realized that Citibank made a mistake when it sent the payments."}

Globally, COVID-19 is now the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe staggering figure is almost certainly an undercount because of limited testing and people dying at home without medical attention, especially in poor parts of the world, such as India.\n\nHot spots have shifted over the 22 months since the outbreak began, turning different places on the world map red. Now, the virus is pummeling Russia, Ukraine and other parts of Eastern Europe, especially where rumors, misinformation and distrust in government have hobbled vaccination efforts. In Ukraine, only 17% of the adult population is fully vaccinated; in Armenia, only 7%.\n\n\"What's uniquely different about this pandemic is it hit hardest the high-resource countries,\" said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, director of ICAP, a global health center at Columbia University. \"That's the irony of COVID-19.\"\n\nWealthier nations with longer life expectancies have larger proportions of older people, cancer survivors and nursing home residents, all of whom are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, El-Sadr noted. Poorer countries tend to have larger shares of children, teens and young adults, who are less likely to fall seriously ill from the coronavirus.\n\nIndia, despite its terrifying delta surge that peaked in early May, now has a much lower reported daily death rate than wealthier Russia, the U.S. or Britain, though there is uncertainty around its figures.\n\nThe seeming disconnect between wealth and health is a paradox that disease experts will be pondering for years. But the pattern that is seen on the grand scale, when nations are compared, is different when examined at closer range. Within each wealthy country, when deaths and infections are mapped, poorer neighborhoods are hit hardest.\n\nIn the U.S., for example, COVID-19 has taken an outsize toll on Black and Hispanic people, who are more likely than white people to live in poverty and have less access to health care.\n\n\"When we get out our microscopes, we see that within countries, the most vulnerable have suffered most,\" Ko said."}

Stiger did not give much ground, saying the officer's knee in some of the contested images still seemed to be near Floyd's neck, though he agreed his weight might have shifted at times.\n\nIn other testimony, the lead Minnesota state investigator on the case, James Reyerson, initially agreed with Nelson that Floyd seemed to say in a police body-camera video of his arrest, \"I ate too many drugs.\"\n\nBut when a prosecutor played a longer clip of the video, Reyerson said he believed what Floyd really said was \"I ain't do no drugs.\"\n\nChauvin, 45, is charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death May 25. Floyd, 46, was arrested outside a neighborhood market after being accused of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. A panicky-sounding Floyd struggled and claimed to be claustrophobic as police tried to put him in a squad car, and they pinned him to the pavement.\n\nBystander video of Floyd crying that he couldn't breathe as onlookers yelled at Chauvin to get off him sparked protests and scattered violence around the U.S.\n\nNelson has argued that the now-fired white officer \"did exactly what he had been trained to do over his 19-year career,\" and he has suggested that Floyd's drug use and his underlying health conditions are what killed him, not Chauvin's knee, as prosecutors contend. Fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in Floyd's system.\n\nBreahna Giles, a state forensic scientist, testified Wednesday that pills found in the SUV Floyd was driving contained methamphetamine and fentanyl. Another witness, forensic chemist Susan Meith, testified that remnants of a pill found in the back of the police squad car also contained methamphetamine and fentanyl. Earlier testimony revealed that this pill contained DNA from Floyd's saliva.\n\nEarlier, Nelson asked Stiger about uses of force that are commonly referred to by police as \"lawful but awful.\" Stiger conceded that \"you can have a situation where by law it looks horrible to the common eye, but based on the state law, it's lawful.\"\n\nNelson has argued, too, that the officers on the scene were distracted by what they perceived as an increasingly hostile crowd of onlookers."}

If the Ever Given is still aground and cannot operate normally, we will not pay the rent,\" a company official told the Taipei Times by telephone.\n\nWhether Evergreen would seek compensation from the ship owner would depend on the cause of the incident, and it would make the decision after an investigation is completed, it added.\n\nLuster Maritime, which is headquartered in Panama and a unit of Japan's Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd, provides sea freight transportation services.\n\nThe incident left dozens of ships gridlocked as they attempted to transit between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean.\n\nEfforts to free the ship had so far proceeded faster than initial warnings that traffic could be choked off for days.\n\nThe 193km-long Suez Canal is among the most trafficked waterways in the world, used by tankers shipping crude from the Middle East to Europe and North America.\n\nAbout 12 percent of global trade and 8 percent of liquefied natural gas pass through the canal, as do about 1 million barrels of oil per day.\n\nThe Ever Given was grounded early on Tuesday amid poor visibility caused by a dust storm and wind speeds that reached 40 knots, resulting in a \"loss of the ability to steer the ship,\" the canal authority said.\n\nAbout 42 vessels either in the northbound convoy or arriving to transit the canal in that direction were waiting for the Ever Given to be refloated, Leth Agencies, one of the top providers of Suez Canal crossing services, said in a notice to clients.\n\nThe company said that it was sending a dredger to help free the ship."}

Would better health advice have saved her?\n\nThe feeling of relief was immense as 58-year-old Michele Brown returned home from the vaccine centre. Her husband, Terry, 61, had taken time off from his job as a supervisor at a heavy machinery factory to drive her to her second Covid-19 vaccination at a Gateshead community centre. In the car, Michele told her partner of 40 years that she felt like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders. \"She said: 'At least we've got that done,'\" Terry remembers. \"'We'll be OK.'\"\n\nIt was 28 April 2021. Michele, who had rheumatoid arthritis, an underactive thyroid and diabetes, had spent the last year and a half shielding indoors, on government advice. She was careful. She had a Covid station set up on the breakfast counter: lateral flow tests, bottles of antibacterial gel and disposable face masks. When family came to visit, a mask-wearing Michele would banish them to the furthest corner of the living room. \"We couldn't kiss her,\" remembers her daughter, Kim Brown, 41, who lives in Durham. \"She would say: 'You might have the coronies! I don't want no coronies. You're not giving me that crap.'\"\n\nAfter her vaccinations, Michele relaxed a tiny bit. She let her family visit more often, and stopped wearing a mask indoors when they did. But she still wasn't going out much: her rheumatoid arthritis made even brief excursions exhausting. Most of the time, Michele stayed home, chatting to Kim on the phone, watching TV and ordering endless packages online. By the time they arrived she rarely had a clue what was in them. When the news came on, Michele would sigh. \"She'd see the numbers go up,\" says Kim, \"and say: 'Those poor people. Those poor families.'\"\n\nMichele's family are mystified as to how she caught Covid – unless one of her rare visitors brought it into the house, or maybe it was when she went for a doctor's appointment. It doesn't really matter. When Michele became infected, it wrecked her body with brutal efficiency. Unknown to her, her immune system had been suppressed, most likely by the drugs she took to manage her arthritis, so her body had failed to mount a good response to the Covid-19 vaccine. In other words, the vaccine hadn't worked for her.\n\n\"I never heard anything like 'immunocompromised',\" says Terry, bewildered and distraught. \"We never did.\"\n\nMichele was born in 1962, in the village of Stannington, Northumberland, the eldest of seven children. Her parents split up when she was an infant. Her father eventually won custody of Michele, but at her request, left her with her grandmother Manuel, who raised her. \"She had a difficult childhood,\" says Kim. \"She swore her kids wouldn't have the same childhood. And we didn't. We had everything we wanted. Love. Affection. We didn't want for anything.\""}

The filing comes just weeks after a jury convicted Chauvin of unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nChauvin's attorney said the court made several errors in handling the case, including \"abuse of discretion that deprived the Defendant of a fair trial; prosecutorial and jury misconduct; errors of law at trial; and a verdict that is contrary to law.\"\n\nWhile the request for a new trial does not include any specific examples of jury misconduct, the filing repeatedly argues that the court failed to shield jury members from the publicity surrounding the trial.\n\n\"The publicity here was so pervasive and so prejudicial before and during this trial that it amounted to a structural defect in the proceedings,\" the filing said. It also accused prosecutors of \"pervasive, prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct\" including disparaging the defense and failing to adequately prepare witnesses.\n\nAlthough the document does not mention any jurors by name, the filing comes amid a controversy surrounding one of the jury members. In a photo at a march in Washington, D.C., last August, juror Brandon Mitchell can be seen wearing a shirt that says \"Get Your Knee Off Our Necks.\"\n\nIn his juror questionnaire, Mitchell said he had not attended any protests against police brutality. Mitchell told CBS Minnesota on Monday that he had attended the march to support voter turnout in the 2020 election.\n\nThe filing also seeks an order for a hearing to \"impeach the verdict,\" on the grounds that \"the jury committed misconduct, felt threatened or intimidated, felt race-based pressure during the proceedings, and/or failed to adhere to instructions during deliberations.\" According to the rule cited in the filing, such a hearing would involve jurors being examined under oath and their testimony being recorded.\n\nUniversity of St. Thomas law professor Rachel Moran told CBS Minnesota that it's unlikely Chauvin's legal team will succeed in overturning the verdict.\n\n\"It's really hard to overturn a conviction, and courts are especially reluctant to interfere with the jury deliberation process,\" Moran said.\n\nThe original jury, which consisted of six White people, four Black people and two multiracial people, heard 13 days of testimony from medical experts and law enforcement officials. Multiple members of the Minneapolis Police Department testified, including the police chief — who told jurors that Chauvin's conduct was \"not part of our training\" and \"certainly not part of our ethics or values.\"\n\nThe jury, which was sequestered during deliberations but not during the earlier part of the trial, reached a verdict in less than a day.\n\nChauvin is now awaiting sentencing on the charges. Second-degree murder carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison in Minnesota. Third-degree murder has a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison, and second-degree manslaughter has a maximum sentence of 10 years.\n\nWhile Chauvin may face less time because he does not have a criminal history, prosecutors have also introduced multiple \"aggravating factors\" that could add to his sentence. His sentencing hearing is scheduled for June 25."}

Yet, Harris – along with her husband, Georgetown Law professor Douglas Emhoff – is still, ostensibly, living out of suitcases, unable to move into the private residence reserved for the vice president because it's still undergoing renovations.\n\nIt's unclear why the renovations are taking so long, said one administration official, but it's a situation that has left Harris increasingly and understandably bothered, according to several people who spoke to CNN about her situation. \"She is getting frustrated,\" said another administration official, noting with each passing day the desire to move in to her designated house – a stately, turreted mansion two-and-a-half miles from the White House – grows more intense.\n\nThe second couple continues to live in temporary housing at Blair House, the President's official guest quarters, just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House.\n\nThe administration has provided no official explanation for the delay, and a spokesperson for Harris did not respond to CNN's request for comment prior to publication.\n\nCNN has looked at various government contracts, awarded for myriad issues at the vice president's residence over the last few years, many of which detail intensive foundational work. From recently wrapped projects on a retention pond to a replaced tank system for $164,000 from last September, repairs and upkeep appear constant. There's also an ongoing $3.8 million contract for \"plumbing, heating and air-conditioning contractors,\" according to the contract on the United States government spending website.\n\nThe contracts, while substantial, aren't overtly egregious in terms of cost and expectation, considering the home is 9,000-plus square feet and was built in 1893. Tax records from 2018 indicate $119,000 in expenses were used to provide updates and improvements in and around the grounds of the residence, for example. However, the current contracts do not address specifically why the vice president is still not living there, which is leading to growing questions – and agitation – about the pace of the work.\n\nHarris has recently been spotted at her future home, popping in for an hour-long visit three weeks ago, per CNN. Two administration staff with knowledge of the ongoing updates told CNN that Harris – who likes to cook – requested work be done on the kitchen. But Sabrina Singh, Harris' deputy press secretary, said in a statement Sunday that \"there is no work being done on the kitchen at the Naval Observatory residence.\"\n\nIt is not unusual for there to be at least a couple of weeks between residents, so the Naval staff who operate the home can refresh, said Elizabeth Haenle, who served as vice president residence manager and social secretary for former Vice President Dick Cheney. \"From time to time, the Navy will ask the vice president and their respective families to delay moving in so that they have time for maintenance and upgrades that are not easy to perform once the vice president takes up residence,\" Haenle said.\n\nShortly after inauguration, a Harris aide told CNN the vice president wouldn't be immediately moving in, citing the need for some repairs to the home \"that are more easily conducted with the home unoccupied.\" A move-in date was still to be determined at the time. Another administration official told CNN some of the work included renovating the home's chimneys – there are seven working fireplaces – as well as other updates.\n\nLacking the comforts of home\n\nAlthough Blair House provides comfortable, even luxurious, accommodations, Harris and Emhoff's current surroundings lack the creature comforts of a home. Antiques and museum-quality pieces of American history deck each of the 100-plus rooms, which include a gym and a private hair salon. And although the professional, full-time staff of more than a dozen provide amenities as accommodating as a luxury hotel, Blair House does not offer the laid-back vibe Harris and Emhoff are said to prefer when they are home. The couple enjoy a more casual, West Coast informality, with frequent visits from family and large Sunday suppers, the former California senator has said."}

(AP) — Administrators in a Michigan school district where four students were shot to death at its high school announced Tuesday that a zero tolerance policy toward threats was being adopted, as well as other initiatives aimed at improving safety.\n\nThe Oxford Community Schools Board of Education was told of the changes at its board meeting — two weeks after the Nov. 30 shooting at Oxford High School that also wounded six students and a teacher.\n\n\"Anything that is remotely violent immediately goes to the administration and law enforcement,\" said Jill Lemond, assistant superintendent of student services.\n\nStudents also will be removed from the school until a mental health evaluation has been completed.\n\nLaw enforcement also will be present in all district schools and a security firm has been hired to make sure every building has its own security guard. Backpacks will no longer be allowed in schools and the district is working with a vendor to provide clear backpacks, she added.\n\nEthan Crumbley, a 15-year-old Oxford High student, has been charged as an adult with murder and other crimes.\n\nHis parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, are charged in the case with involuntary manslaughter.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a judge granted a prosecutor more time to collect and share additional evidence against the parents, partly to give the Michigan community \"time to heal\" during the holiday season.\n\nThey're accused of giving their son access to a gun and failing to intervene when they were confronted with his disturbing drawings a few hours before the Nov. 30 shooting.\n\nSchool officials have been criticized by the county sheriff and Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald for not alerting a school resource officer about their concerns with the teen and not searching his backpack before allowing him to return to class about three hours before the shooting at the school about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Detroit.\n\nLori Bourgeau, 45, an Oxford Village councilwoman and parent of an 11th-grader, pointed a finger at the board and policies in place before the shooting.\n\n\"Who sets the example of where the complaints (about students) go?\" Bourgeau said during public participation at Tuesday night's meeting. \"You let it stay with the counselor and the dean of students, only. Searching for ammo. Letters, pictures of shooting and there's no disciplinary file? That's not OK. Don't let a kid come in and search for ammo and go back to class. You set the tone. I wish you would have done that a month ago. You could have saved lives.\"\n\nAbout a dozen of the 80 or so people attending the board meeting addressed its members.\n\nShane Gibson, 43, told the board that his daughter, who is in third grade, \"asked me if she goes to school if she is going to die and it literally broke my heart.\"\n\n\"The loss of innocence for these children is the most heartbreaking,\" he said. \"My son and my daughter will be living with this for the rest of their lives.\"\n\nEthan Crumbley had a brief court hearing Monday and will return on Jan. 7 to allow his lawyer to review evidence.\n\nHis parents were arrested on Dec. 4 hiding in a commercial building in Detroit, hours after their charges were announced. They remain in jail, apparently unable to pay bonds of $500,000 each, though defense attorney Shannon Smith said she would ask for new terms on Jan. 7.\n\nJudge Julie Nicholson granted a request by prosecutors and defense lawyers to postpone until Feb. 8 a key hearing that will determine whether the elder Crumbleys will face a trial, instead of plowing ahead on Dec. 22.\n\n\"These funerals have just recently concluded,\" McDonald said. \"The prosecutor's office has a lot of work to do with a lot of the victims and the families. We do not think it's in their best interest or in the interests of justice to do that during the holiday season.\"\n\nThe prosecutor said that a delay in court proceedings would help her office prepare and also give Oxford \"time to heal to the extent that's possible.\"\n\nIn court, the Crumbleys sat on the outside of their two lawyers. But when the lawyers got up to speak privately to the judge, James Crumbley mouthed \"I love you\" to his wife."}

Learn more about vaccines – from how they work and how they're made to ensuring safety and equitable access – in WHO's Vaccines Explained series.\n\nVaccines are a critical tool in the battle against COVID-19, and getting vaccinated is one of the best ways to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.\n\nGetting vaccinated is safer than getting infected\n\nVaccines train our immune system to recognize the targeted virus and create antibodies to fight off the disease without getting the disease itself. After vaccination, the body is ready to fight the virus if it is later exposed to it, thereby preventing illness.\n\nMost people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, develop an immune response within the first few weeks, but we are still learning how strong and lasting that immune response is, and how it varies between different people.\n\nPeople who have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 should still get vaccinated unless told otherwise by their health care provider. Even if you've had a previous infection, the vaccine acts as a booster that strengthens the immune response. There have also been some instances of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 a second time, which makes getting vaccinated even more important.\n\nWhat to expect during vaccination\n\nMedical professionals can best advise individuals on whether or not, and when, they should receive a vaccine. A health worker will administer the vaccine, and the person receiving it will be asked to wait for 15–30 minutes before leaving the vaccination site. This is so that health workers can observe individuals for any unexpected reactions following vaccination.\n\nLike any vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild-to-moderate side effects, such as a low-grade fever or pain or redness at the injection site. These should go away on their own within a few days. See WHO's Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines explainer and Vaccines Safety Q&A to learn more about common side effects and find out who should consult with a doctor before vaccination.\n\nVaccine doses\n\nFor some COVID-19 vaccines, two doses are required. It's important to get the second dose if the vaccine requires two doses.\n\nFor vaccines that require two doses, the first dose presents antigens – proteins that stimulate the production of antibodies – to the immune system for the first time. Scientists call this priming the immune response. The second dose acts as a booster, ensuring the immune system develops a memory response to fight off the virus if it encounters it again.\n\nBecause of the urgent need for a COVID-19 vaccine, initial clinical trials of vaccine candidates were performed with the shortest possible duration between doses. Therefore an interval of 21–28 days (3–4 weeks) between doses is recommended by WHO. Depending on the vaccine, the interval may be extended for up to 42 days – or even up to 12 weeks for some vaccines – on the basis of current evidence.\n\nThere are many COVID-19 vaccines being developed and produced by different manufacturers around the world. WHO recommends that a vaccine from the same manufacturer be used for both doses if you require two doses. This recommendation may be updated as further information becomes available.\n\nSafety against infection and transmission after vaccination\n\nAvailable clinical trials have shown COVID-19 vaccines to be safe and highly effective at preventing severe disease. Given how new COVID-19 is, researchers are still looking into how long a vaccinated person is likely to be protected from infection, and whether vaccinated people can still transmit the virus to others. As the vaccine rollout expands, WHO will continue to monitor the data alongside regulatory authorities."}

Clinton was given the Secret Service codename \"Evergreen\" when her husband Bill Clinton was president.\n\nThe ship's call sign is H3RC—the same three letters as the initials of the 2016 presidential candidate.\n\nOn the Telegram encrypted messaging app, a QAnon account with more than 106,000 subscribers wrote: \"Suez Canal blocked by huge container ship named Evergreen. Evergreen shipping is most likely a cover for human and sex trafficking.\n\n\"HRC = Hillary Rodham Clinton. Evergreen = Hillary's Secret Service name. Evergreen Call Sign: H3RC.\"\n\nAnother influential QAnon advocate with more than 53,000 subscribers on the \"free speech\" social network Gab wrote: \"Evergreen is HRC's Secret Service name. It has also been speculated that Evergreen shipping is a front for human trafficking.\n\n\"Theory: ship gets stuck, International aid offered, containers opened on live TV.\"\n\nQAnon supporters often twist world events to suit their theories or claim they have been predicted by the mysterious figure known as \"Q.\"\n\nFor years, \"Q\" would leave cryptic messages on messageboard sites, which were deciphered to form the basis of the conspiracy theorists' beliefs. These include the notion that leading Democrats and members of the Hollywood elite are child-eating pedophiles.\n\nThe first of these so-called \"Qdrops\" appeared on 4chan in October 2017, claiming that Clinton would soon be arrested.\n\nFor the next few years, thousands of the posts appeared online, often using phrases that became QAnon slogans.\n\nNo new messages have been posted for months, however, with their frequency slowing down considerably since former President Donald Trump, a savior-like figure for QAnon, lost the election in November.\n\nThe conspiracy theorists do not necessarily need new posts to guide the movement, however. They simply reinterpret the existing catalog of messages to suit their purpose.\n\nIn this case, the attempt to move the ship from the Suez Canal was predicted because \"Q\" had previously mentioned Evergreen and the words \"when do you need a plumber?\" in an April 2018 post.\n\n\"When do you call a plumber? When something's maybe 'blocked'?\" one widely shared Telegram by some of the biggest QAnon channels read. \"WE HAVE IT ALL.\"\n\nThis is not the first time an Evergreen vessel has been roped into a QAnon child trafficking conspiracy.\n\nIn August 2020, a similar rumor was spread after the explosion at the port of Beirut, which killed more than 200 people."}

The attacks killed at least 60 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops, Afghan and U.S. officials said.\n\nThe U.S. general overseeing the evacuation said the attacks would not stop the United States from evacuating Americans and others, and flights out were continuing. Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said there was a large amount of security at the airport, and alternate routes were being used to get evacuees in. About 5,000 people were awaiting flights on the airfield, McKenzie said.\n\nThe blasts came hours after Western officials warned of a major attack, urging people to leave the airport. But that advice went largely unheeded by Afghans desperate to escape the country in the last few days of an American-led evacuation before the U.S. officially ends its 20-year presence on Aug. 31.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the killings on its Amaq news channel. The IS affiliate in Afghanistan is far more radical than the Taliban, who recently took control of the country in a lightning blitz. The Taliban were not believed to have been involved in the attacks and condemned the blasts.\n\nIn an emotional speech from the White House, U.S. President Joe Biden said the latest bloodshed would not drive the U.S. out of Afghanistan earlier than scheduled, and that he had instructed the U.S. military to develop plans to strike IS.\n\n\"We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,\" Biden said.\n\nU.S. officials initially said 11 Marines and one Navy medic were among those who died. Another service member died hours later. Eighteen service members were wounded and officials warned the toll could grow. More than 140 Afghans were wounded, an Afghan official said.\n\nOne of the bombers struck people standing knee-deep in a wastewater canal under the sweltering sun, throwing bodies into the fetid water. Those who moments earlier had hoped to get on flights out could be seen carrying the wounded to ambulances in a daze, their own clothes darkened with blood.\n\nEmergency, an Italian charity that operates hospitals in Afghanistan, said it had received at least 60 patients wounded in the airport attack, in addition to 10 who were dead when they arrived.\n\n\"Surgeons will be working into the night,\" said Marco Puntin, the charity's manager in Afghanistan. The wounded overflowed the triage zone into the physiotherapy area and more beds were being added, he said.\n\nThe Afghan official who confirmed the overall Afghan toll spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief media.\n\nPentagon spokesman John Kirby said one explosion was near an airport entrance and another was a short distance away by a hotel. McKenzie said clearly some failure at the airport allowed a suicide bomber to get so close to the gate.\n\nHe said the Taliban has been screening people outside the gates, though there was no indication that the Taliban deliberately allowed Thursday's attacks to happen. He said the U.S. has asked Taliban commanders to tighten security around the airport's perimeter.\n\nAdam Khan was waiting nearby when he saw the first explosion outside what's known as the Abbey gate. He said several people appeared to have been killed or wounded, including some who were maimed."}

Group That Claimed Responsibility for Kabul Airport Attack Is a Rival of the Taliban\n\nLast Thursday, a bombing and shooting outside Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 150 Afghan civilians.\n\nThe group that has claimed responsibility is known as the Islamic State Khorasan or ISIS-K, a regional affiliate of the Islamic State and, officials say, a dangerous threat in the region.\n\nOn Monday — one day ahead of a deadline the U.S. had set to leave Afghanistan — the Pentagon announced it had officially withdrawn from the country, ending a 20-year war with a sometimes chaotic evacuation of Americans and Afghan refugees spurred in part, said President Joe Biden, by ISIS-K's planned attacks on U.S. troops and others.\n\nIn a White House speech on Tuesday, Biden lauded the military for completing what he called one of the \"biggest airlifts in history.\"\n\n\"For weeks, they risked their lives to get American citizens [and] Afghans who helped us ... onboard planes and out of the country,\" Biden said, \"and they did it knowing ISIS-K terrorists — sworn enemies of the Taliban — were lurking in the midst of the crowd.\"\n\nHere's what to know about the group.\n\nIt's a branch of Islamic State extremists\n\nThe Islamic State Khorasan — also known by the acronyms ISIS-K, ISKP and ISK — has been recognized by Islamic State leadership, making it an official branch of the religious extremist movement that sought to take over parts of Iraq and Syria some eight years ago before being beat back by U.S.-led forces.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Economics and Peace's Global Terrorism Index — which ranked ISIS-K among the top four deadliest terrorist organizations in the world in 2019 — the group emerged in 2014 and seeks to establish a caliphate (an Islamic government) in what they call Khorasan, a term for a region historically covering parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and Central Asia.\n\nAccording to West Point's Combatting Terrorism Center, the group was founded by former members of the Pakistani Taliban, the Afghan Taliban and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and includes members from a number of other militant and terror groups.\n\nIt's a rival of the Taliban\n\nAs President Biden noted in his Tuesday remarks, ISIS-K is an enemy of the Taliban despite the two groups fighting the U.S.\n\nWhile the Taliban brutally ruled Afghanistan prior to the U.S. invasion of the country in 2001, ISIS-K is said to be even more extreme in its views of women and ethnic minorities — and its members had splintered from the Taliban over these views.\n\nIn May, the group bombed a girls' school attended by Hazara (a religious and ethnic minority) students, killing more than than 85 Hazara children.\n\nThen, in early June, the Islamic State claimed responsibility after masked gunmen shot dead 10 mine-clearers working in Afghanistan's northern province of Baghlan, specifically targeting Hazara workers.\n\nThe CEO of the company that owned the mine told the BBC in a previous interview that members of the Taliban attempted to help those caught in the crossfire.\n\n\"I think it's important to know that the Taliban have denied responsibility for this, and indeed the local Taliban group came to our aid and scared the assailants off,\" he told the network.\n\nThe Taliban also condemned last week's Kabul airport attack, with a spokesperson for the group saying in a statement: \"Evil circles will strictly be stopped.\"\n\nExperts have said the rivalry means that the Taliban won't likely offer members of ISIS-K safe haven in Afghanistan — at least for now."}

In a statement from CNN to Forbes, Wallace said he is \"excited to explore the world of streaming. I look forward to the new freedom and flexibility streaming affords in interviewing major figures across the news landscape—and finding new ways to tell stories.\" Fox News said they are \"extremely proud of our journalism\" and of Wallace, and Fox News Sunday will continue to be hosted by a rotation of anchors \"until a permanent host is named,\" according to the New York Times. Wallace was allegedly unhappy with Fox's airing of host Tucker Carlson's series Patriot Purge, in which interviewees spread conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol: NPR reported last month that Wallace complained to higher-ups at the network about the program, and he interviewed Rep. Liz Cheney, who rejected the claims made in the series. Wallace's Fox News colleague Bret Baier tweeted it was \"an honor to work alongside\" Wallace, though Carlson and other Fox personalities remained mum on his departure.\n\nTangent\n\nWallace's exit comes amid a flurry of high-profile media shakeups. Last month, Brian Williams announced he was leaving NBC after 28 years. Last week, CNN fired star anchor Chris Cuomo after it was revealed he aided his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, through the latter's sexual harassment scandal.\n\nKey Background\n\nWallace, 74, is the son of journalist Mike Wallace, one of the original hosts of \"60 Minutes.\" During his time on Fox, Wallace moderated two presidential debates, in 2016 and 2020. He is known for holding a hard line with interviewees and other Fox personalities, and criticizing his colleagues for being too partisan or for for going after \"the media.\" Former President Trump attacked Wallace's coverage of him often, sometimes while appearing on Fox, as some other personalities on the network were not as critical of the then-president. Wallace has said he was \"sickened\" by the Jan. 6 attack and he stopped inviting some lawmakers who challenged the election results on his show because he doesn't \"want to hear their crap.\"\n\nCrucial Quote"}

The professional golfer wore a black compression sleeve that covered his right leg, as noted by NY Post.\n\nIt's Woods' love for his family that keeps him motivated to keep pushing towards a full recovery. Sources say the decorated PGA Tour champion \"lives for\" his son Charlie and 14-year-old daughter Sam with his ex-wife Elin Nordegren. His sighting at Charlie's game followed a \"remarkable\" recovery process for Woods.\n\n\"Tiger has made a remarkable recovery in the past few months, but it's even more significant lately,\" the source said. \"It's like every day he can do more, he can handle more, the pain is less and he's feeling better.\"\n\n\"He has worked very hard in physical therapy. ... He has had an incredible recovery,\" the source said. The pro athlete is \"feeling strong and healthy and optimistic that he'll be able to return to tour.\"\n\nWhile it remains unknown when Woods will return to the game, he reportedly has a \"timeframe in his head,\" the insider said. \"He knows when he wants to return, and he's going to make it happen.\"\n\nWoods last appeared on the PGA Tour at the Masters in November 2020, where he finished T38th, as noted by Golf Monthly."}

Trump is joined on the call by White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and several lawyers. CNN obtained the audio from a source who was on the call and had direct knowledge of the conversation.

Gavin Newsom. Newsom chose the first Latino in state history for the role.\n\nSpeaking before Harris, Senate candidate Jon Ossoff said Trump was actively attempting to \"disenfranchise Black voters\" in the state.\n\n\"That is a direct attack on our democracy. And if David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler had one piece of steel in their spines, one shred of integrity, they would be out here defending Georgia voters from that kind of assault,\" Ossoff said.\n\nBoth Harris and Biden, who will be returning to Atlanta on Monday, are making their final push into the Peach State in hopes that the Democratic Party will gain control of the Senate and start their administration with a unified government."}

Maybe America Is Gonna Pull Through.\n\n\"Don't give up,\" New Radicals begged us in their classic 1998 single \"You Get What You Give.\" And if they didn't take their own advice, if they never followed up on that pop song's promise, if they left our nation wanting a whole lot more, today is a day to celebrate. The band has reunited after 22 years to perform the song as part of the Biden-Harris virtual inaugural parade. It is a benediction for a next-level '90s pop song, an exclamation point at the end of a joyful day, a \"Don't Stop\" moment for a new generation.\n\nIt is, to borrow a phrase from our new President, a big fucking deal. Here's why.\n\nIf you're new to the Radicals, the band was essentially a duo: singer Gregg Alexander and percussionist Danielle Brisebois. Michigan-born Alexander had bounced around the music business as a little-known teenage pop artist in the late 1980s, while Brisebois achieved success as a child actor, starring in the later seasons of All In The Family and on Broadway as the original Molly in Annie. After Brisebois was recruited to sing backing vocals on Alexander's second solo album Intoxifornication, they went on to co-write tracks for her first, Arrive All Over You. If it had stopped with simply those two album titles, it would have been enough. But it didn't; there was a spark, they formed a band, and they got signed by MCA Records, because MCA Records knew what was up.\n\nMaybe You've Been Brainwashed Too was released in late 1998 to instant critical acclaim, and for good reason. It is what we would now call \"a mood,\" and a particularly good one. It is an early summer day all year long, an antidepressant with zero side effects. Alexander wrote and produced every track, finally nailing his unique sound, which has endured long after he disappeared. (More on that later.) Though the album is best known for its one hit single, it is banger city from start to finish.\n\nAnd oh that one hit single. \"You Get What You Give\" is the greatest pop-rock song of the last 25 years, and if you disagree, I need you to take a quiet moment and reflect on why you've chosen to reject pleasure. Though the song-ending call-outs of Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson still get most of the attention, the song itself is about the resilience of the human spirit. Its chugging piano is the sound of a soul struggling to see the bright side. The song gave us the word \"frenemies,\" and the video sent me on a still-fruitless search for that windbreaker. It is the perfect jam for a tense time in history, a song whose optimism is hard-won.\n\nFlatiron Books Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose Flatiron Books Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose Now 72% Off $8 at Amazon\n\nIt is for that reason that the song has significance to the Biden family. In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, President Biden reveals that his son Beau used \"You Get What You Give\" as a psych-up song for his chemotherapy treatments, and when it became clear that his brain cancer was inoperable, the family continued to play it for him to keep his spirits up. In honor of Beau, First Gentleman Doug Emhoff uses it as his walk-on music. It's in the pantheon.\n\nNew Radicals dissolved before their second single \"Someday We'll Know\" was released, as Alexander found the spotlight too stressful. But even if you didn't know it, you still had their music in you. Brisebois co-wrote Natasha Bedingfield's \"Unwritten,\" while Alexander lent his signature sound to Santana & Michelle Branch's \"The Game Of Love,\" the Oscar-nominated \"Lost Stars\" from Begin Again, and what pop historians unanimously recognize as our greatest blowjob anthem, \"I'm Gonna Blow Your Mind\" by Carly Hennessy, who would later go on to American Idol fame as Carly Smithson. Dude's been busy."}

These rare occurrences are known as \"breakthrough cases\" which are to be expected, and historically known to occur with other vaccines as none is 100% effective.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently monitors hospitalizations and deaths, from any cause, among fully vaccinated individuals with COVID-19, but not breakthrough infections, which it stopped monitoring as of May 1. CDC presents this data in aggregate at the national level but not by state, and there is no single, public repository for data by state or data on breakthrough infections, since the CDC stopped monitoring them.\n\nWe therefore reviewed the websites and other official state sources for all 50 states and D.C. to see which are providing data on COVID-19 breakthrough cases, hospitalizations and deaths, how regularly, and what those data may tell us. We only used data from official state sources (we did not include data available only in news media reports, for example). Where a state did not provide comparable data on overall COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, or deaths reported over the period in which it captured breakthrough events, we obtained data on cases and deaths from the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dashboard and on hospitalizations from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services for the appropriate period (see methods for more detail).\n\nImportantly, not all hospitalizations and deaths of those fully vaccinated and diagnosed with COVID-19 are due to COVID-19 or have a known cause at the time of reporting. The CDC reports that as of July 19, of 5,601 hospitalized breakthrough cases, 27% were asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19 and of 1,141 fatal cases, 26% were asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19. States differ in whether they provide this detail. DC, for example, reports that as of July 11, 50% of hospitalized breakthrough cases were due to COVID-19, 19% were not, and 31% were of unknown reason. However, few states made these distinctions. Where they did, we only included breakthrough hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19. In other cases, some of these breakthrough events may be due to causes other than COVID-19.\n\nOverall, we find that:\n\nHalf of states (25) report some data on COVID-19 breakthrough events (see Table 1) . Twenty-four provide data on breakthrough cases, 19 on hospitalizations and on deaths.\n\nTwenty-four provide data on breakthrough cases, 19 on hospitalizations and on deaths. Fifteen of these states regularly update these data, often on a weekly basis. The rest use a different frequency, have one-time reports, have stopped updating, or have an unclear reporting frequency.\n\nThe rest use a different frequency, have one-time reports, have stopped updating, or have an unclear reporting frequency. The data reported from these states indicate that breakthrough cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are extremely rare events among those who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (see Figure 1). The rate of breakthrough cases reported among those fully vaccinated is below 1% in all reporting states, ranging from 0.01% in Connecticut to 0.54% in Arkansas. The hospitalization rate among fully vaccinated people with COVID-19 ranged from effectively zero (0.00%) in California, Delaware, D.C., Indiana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Vermont, and Virginia to 0.06% in Arkansas. (Note: Hospitalization may or may not have been due to COVID-19.) The rates of death among fully vaccinated people with COVID-19 were even lower, effectively zero (0.00%) in all but two reporting states, Arkansas and Michigan where they were 0.01%. (Note: Deaths may or may not have been due to COVID-19.)\n\nThe rate of breakthrough cases reported among those fully vaccinated is below 1% in all reporting states, ranging from 0.01% in Connecticut to 0.54% in Arkansas.\n\nAlmost all (more than 9 in 10) COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have occurred among people who are unvaccinated or not yet fully vaccinated, in those states reporting breakthrough data (see Figure 2). The reported share of COVID-19 cases among those not fully vaccinated ranged from 94.1% in Arizona to 99.85% Connecticut. The share of hospitalizations among those with COVID-19 who are not fully vaccinated ranged from in 95.02% in Alaska to 99.93% in New Jersey. (Note: Hospitalization may or may not have been due to COVID-19.) The share of deaths among people with COVID-19 who are not fully vaccinated ranged from to 96.91% in Montana to 99.91% in New Jersey. (Note: Deaths may or may not have been due to COVID-19.)\n\nNote that as more people get vaccinated, the share of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths accounted for by unvaccinated people will tend to fall, since there will be fewer unvaccinated people in the population. That will be true even if infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 is still very rare among vaccinated people."}

The extent of the coverage reflected Woods' status as one of the greatest golfers — and athletes — of all time.\n\n\"This is a tough guy, a very strong guy...He knows what it takes to endure a significant amount of pain,\" sportscaster Jim Gray said on Fox News which, like other networks, provided updates on his condition along with overhead helicopter shots of the neighborhood where the crash occurred, Rancho Palos Verdes, along with shots of the accident scene.\n\nSuch breaking news moments often are a bit of an exercise in filling time with relatively scant information about what happened.\n\nOn MSNBC, Cindy Boren of The Washington Post talked of Woods' recent trouble with his back and his recent surgery. She was asked if Woods was determined to continue playing out of a desire to break Jack Nicklaus' record for Masters wins. \"More important to him right now is his kids,\" she said.\n\nOn CNN, Kyung Lah read a statement from the PGA, which mentioned that Woods was in surgery, but cautioned that she didn't know when the statement was written.\n\n\"These pictures are obviously very alarming,\" she said, referring to images of the mangled car from which Woods reportedly was removed via the jaws of life.

We are thinking about his family and his two children,\" said anchor Brooke Baldwin.\n\nLater, she brought in CNN sports anchor Don Riddell, who talked of Woods' comeback in the 2019 Masters. He shared a story of talking with Woods a couple of years ago, and Woods mentioning that he thought the \"greatest comeback of all time\" was golfer Ben Hogan, who was in a serious car accident in the 1940s. \"We talk about narrative arcs and storylines, and now we have Tiger Woods potentially in a very, very similar situation,\" Riddell said."}

Social media platforms such as Facebook have traditionally taken a light touch to policing speech posted by politicians, maintaining that people have a right to see statements from their leaders.\n\nBut following the riot, social media platforms including Facebook removed Trump's account and tightened enforcement around misinformation policies.\n\n\"With continued attempts to organize events against the outcome of the US presidential election that can lead to violence, and use of the [\"stop the steal\"] term by those involved in Wednesday's violence in DC, we're taking this additional step in the lead-up to the inauguration,\" Facebook said in a blog post.\n\nOn Monday, Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said that Trump's account will be suspended until at least the inauguration and perhaps longer.

That decision, made in light of his encouragement for Wednesday's violent invasion of the U.S. Capitol, might seem sudden for anyone not particularly familiar with his Twitter presence.\n\nIn reality, Twitter gave Trump many, many second chances over his four years as president, keeping him on the platform due to the company's belief that speech by world leaders is in the public interest, even if it breaks the rules.\n\nNow that Trump's gone for good, we have a pretty interesting glimpse into the policy decision making that led Twitter to bring the hammer down on Friday. The company first announced Trump's ban in a series of tweets from its @TwitterSafety account but also linked to a blog post detailing its thinking.\n\nIn that deep dive, the company explains that it gave Trump one last chance after suspending and then reinstating his account for violations made on Wednesday. But the following day, a pair of tweets the president made pushed him over the line. Twitter said those tweets, pictured below, were not examined on a standalone basis, but rather in the context of his recent behavior and this week's events.\n\n\"... We have determined that these Tweets are in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy and the user @realDonaldTrump should be immediately permanently suspended from the service,\" Twitter wrote.\n\nThis is how the company explained its reasoning, point by point:\n\n\"President Trump's statement that he will not be attending the Inauguration is being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate and is seen as him disavowing his previous claim made via two Tweets (1, 2) by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino, that there would be an 'orderly transition' on January 20th.\n\n\"The second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a 'safe' target, as he will not be attending.\n\n\"The use of the words 'American Patriots' to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol.\n\n\"The mention of his supporters having a 'GIANT VOICE long into the future' and that 'They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!' is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an 'orderly transition' and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election.\n\n\"Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021.\""}

While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately.\n\n\"Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much-loved family members.\"\n\nThe statement followed two days of crisis talks among senior royals and palace aides over how best to handle the very public fallout from the interview.\n\nBuckingham Palace had no advance warning of what the couple had said before the broadcast on CBS in the early hours of Monday, which was watched by more than 11 million UK viewers on Monday night, taking its transatlantic audience to almost 30 million.\n\nThe couple's allegations, particularly on race and mental health issues, led to calls for an investigation by the palace. The palace statement indicates the Queen favours private engagement with the couple as the best way forward.\n\nThe couple agreed to the Winfrey interview in order to share \"their truth\". The wording of the Queen's statement indicates other members of the royal family may have different truths, but there is no hint of criticism of the couple in it.\n\nIt is unclear which issues the Queen is referring to when she says \"recollections may vary\" but it could refer to remarks over Archie's skin colour, or, perhaps, the fact the couple believed protocol was to be changed to deny their son the automatic title of prince when Charles accedes the throne."}

The movie's director, Joel Souza, 48, was taken by ambulance to a medical center.\n\nIt was not clear if Baldwin was performing at the time of the shooting or how many rounds were fired, and little was known about the weapon.\n\nProp guns fire blanks, gunpowder charges that produce a flash and a bang but not a hard projectile. But when the trigger is pulled, the paper or plastic wadding is ejected from the barrel with enough force that it can be lethal at close range.\n\nHollywood weapons expert Larry Zanoff told NBC News that when firearms are used as props in the television and movie industry, only blank cartridges that do not hold bullets are allowed on set. Zanoff said there is a minimum safety distance of 20 feet and \"nothing\" should be in front of the muzzle when filming is occurring.\n\n\"We have a series of guidelines in the industry that govern the use of blank firearms and ammunition on set,\" he said. \"So my question is of course, firstly, was that protocol followed?\"\n\nHutchins' shocking on-set death immediately drew comparisons to the untimely death of Brandon Lee.\n\nIn 1993, Brandon Lee, 28, son of the late martial-arts star Bruce Lee, died after being hit by a .44-caliber slug while filming a death scene for the movie \"The Crow.\" The gun was supposed to have fired a blank, but an autopsy turned up a bullet lodged near his spine.\n\nLee's death was the last recorded accidental death by a prop gun on a movie set.\n\nA verified Twitter account for Brandon — run by his sister, Shannon Lee, according to the account's bio — tweeted early Friday that \"No one should ever be killed by a gun on a film set. Period.\"\n\nIn 1984, actor Jon-Erik Hexum died after shooting himself in the head with a prop gun blank while pretending to play Russian roulette with a .44 Magnum on the set of the CBS television series \"Cover Up.\"\n\nIn 1982, Actor Vic Morrow, 53, and child actors Myca Dinh Le, 7, and Renee Shin-Yi Chen, 6, were killed in a helicopter crash on the set of \"Twilight Zone: The Movie.\" An explosion during a chase scene sent the helicopter crashing to the ground.\n\nTheir deaths prompted increased safety regulations for stunts and also resulted in a trial in which director John Landis and others on the production team were ultimately acquitted of involuntary manslaughter charges.\n\nThe prop firearm was discharged by actor Alec Baldwin while filming \"Rush\" in Santa Fe, N.M., according to authorities. The film's director of photography was killed and the director was injured.\n\nAnd while filming accidents resulting in death or injury of a big movie or TV star is rare, a 2016 Associated Press report found that, since 1990, at least 43 people have died on sets in the U.S. and more than 150 have been left with life-altering injuries."}

The judge set November 1 as the new date to begin the trial, with a May 17 status hearing.\n\nRittenhouse faces multiple felony counts, including reckless homicide and reckless endangerment. He also faces a misdemeanour count of being a minor in possession of a firearm.\n\nRittenhouse appeared with his lawyer during the court hearing broadcast over Zoom. He spoke only when the judge asked him if he had any problem with the delay, which would push his trial start to more than a year after the shootings.\n\n\"No, your honour,\" Rittenhouse said. He was seated behind his lawyer, wearing a mask. The judge cautioned that the trial could be pushed even further, saying the November date was \"not written in stone\".\n\nAssistant District Attorney Thomas Binger said both sides needed more time, citing a \"number of outstanding issues\", including DNA testing.\n\nRittenhouse's lawyer, Mark Richards, agreed to the November trial start.\n\n\"We're interested in moving this matter forward but whatever the court decides, we'll abide by,\" he said.\n\nLegal reckoning\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Rittenhouse, who is white, travelled to Kenosha from his home in Antioch, Illinois, on August 25 after a local militia posted an online message seeking help protecting businesses from protesters. Kenosha was in the throes of several nights of chaotic protests after a white police officer shot Jacob Blake, who is Black, in the back during a domestic disturbance. The shooting left Blake paralysed from the waist down.\n\nRittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, opened fire on protesters Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz with an AR-15-style rifle. Rosenbaum and Huber died, while Grosskreutz survived with wounds.\n\nGrosskreutz and his lawyer also attended the hearing but did not speak.\n\nRittenhouse has argued that he fired in self-defence after the three protesters attacked him. Police let him walk through their lines in the moments following the shootings, even though Rittenhouse still had his rifle slung over his shoulder and protesters were screaming that he had just shot three people.\n\nConservatives have rallied around him, painting him as a symbol for gun rights. They generated $2m for his bail in November.\n\nBlack Lives Matter supporters have worked to define him as a trigger-happy white supremacist. Richards told Schroeder last month that Rittenhouse has received threats and has moved into an undisclosed safe house.\n\nThe delay comes as courts begin to deal with the legal ramifications of the BLM movement.\n\nJury selection began on Monday in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with the murder of George Floyd.\n\nFloyd's death, which occurred while Chauvin's knee was on his neck, sparked national protests.\n\nThe trial of Andrea Sahouri, an Iowa journalist arrested while covering the protests and charged with failure to disperse and interfering with official acts, also began on Monday.\n\nKenneth Walker, Breonna Taylor's boyfriend at the time of her death, was cleared of all charges related to the shooting of a police officer during the botched raid that killed Taylor, also on Monday.\n\nTaylor's name, along with Floyd's and others, were mentioned at BLM protests during the summer."}

This doesn't mean members of Congress and staff are under investigation, but the FBI is checking the veracity of the claims, the officials said.\n\nCounterterrorism strategy for arrests\n\nAt least some of the arrests already made are part of a strategy used in counterterrorism investigations, to find even a minimal charge and try to take a person of concern off the streets. That helps ease the possible threat amid concern about possible attacks on the inauguration, officials believe.\n\nOn January 4, for example, local police arrested the leader of the Proud Boys, Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, in Washington, DC.\n\nTarrio was taken into custody for allegedly burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a Black church last month during protests in the city after an earlier \"Stop the Steal\" rally. The Miami resident was charged with destruction of property related to the banner, however, federal authorities say they found Tarrio in possession of two high-capacity firearm magazines, prompting them to add a charge of Possession of High Capacity Feeding Device.\n\nOn Tuesday, federal authorities in New York City arrested Eduard Florea, 40, on at least one weapons charge after law enforcement, including the FBI and NYPD, responded to a Queens home in response to online postings about an armed caravan heading to the US Capitol, two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN.\n\nLaw enforcement sources told CNN that the man claims to be a Proud Boy and was arrested with live ammunition in the home.\n\nAlready, the public efforts by prosecutors and the FBI to encourage people who participated In the riot to turn themselves in is yielding fruit. Some attorneys have reached out to arrange for safe surrender of their clients in order to gain a measure of leniency and lessen the chance of a police raid on their homes, two officials said.\n\nFor instance, a counterterrorism prosecutor even appeared in court for an early hearing for one of the defendants on Tuesday, signaling how integrated the Justice Department's effort already is between the typical criminal prosecutors who handle initial criminal hearings and with the units focused on more complex crimes.\n\n\"With this strike force that was established to focus strictly on sedition charges, we're looking at in treating this just like a significant international counterterrorism or counterintelligence operation,\" DC US Attorney Michael Sherwin said Tuesday.\n\n\"We're looking at everything: money, travel records. Looking at disposition, movement, communication records. So no resource related to the FBI, or the US Attorney's Office will be unchecked in terms of trying to determine exactly if there was a command and control how it operated and how they executed these, these activities.\""}

Why I back Bill Belichick in the Tom Brady vs. the coach debate\n\nFOXBORO — Rodney Harrison is upset.\n\nI don't blame him. The question, which I asked, was unfair. I even acknowledged as much.\n\n\"Who deserves more credit for the Patriots' success — Tom Brady or Bill Belichick?\"\n\nIt's a debate that's raged on for a while now, but it's heated up recently. It's easy to understand why. Brady left the Patriots and won a Super Bowl without Belichick. As soon as that happened, people declared Brady the winner.\n\nBrady 1, Belichick 0.\n\nNow, on Sunday, we have Brady returning with his reigning Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers to take on Belichick's 1-2 Patriots squad. Hence the reason why the topic has come up again, and it's understandable that it seems Brady is getting the bulk of the credit. Without Brady, Belichick's Patriots finished 7-9 in 2020. Without Brady, Belichick is 63-75 in his career.\n\n'It wasn't a question of not wanting him': Belichick says he never wanted Brady to leave\n\nIn reality, those numbers are misleading. Football isn't about one person. It's not about one coach. It's about 11 players on offense and 11 players on defense. It's about teamwork. It's about \"doing your job\" to accomplish higher goals.\n\nThat's why Harrison is upset.\n\n\"I think it's stupid, OK?\" Harrison replied to our question. \"I think it's disrespectful. Not only is it disrespectful to Tom and Bill, but it's disrespectful to all those great players that came along that were part of those championship teams because, at the end of the day, it wasn't Bill and Tom versus everybody else. It was an entire team. ... I just think it's dumb.\"\n\nHarrison makes a fair point. The Patriots didn't win six Super Bowls just because of Brady and/or Belichick. There are hundreds of players who helped bring those championships to New England. Where would the Pats be without Adam Vinatieri? Or Malcolm Butler? Ty Law? Julian Edelman?\n\nWhen the Pats won their last Super Bowl, the offense scored just 13 points. That's the worst scoring output by a Super Bowl winner in NFL history. The real story of that win over the Los Angeles Rams was the team's defense that allowed three points — that's also an NFL Super Bowl record.\n\nFrom the coach: Belichick denies talk of a bad relationship with Brady\n\nFootball is the ultimate team game.\n\nThe problem is, I disagree, slightly, with Harrison and mostly everyone on this topic."}

The authorization was based on the FDA's thorough and transparent evaluation of the data that included input from independent advisory committee experts who overwhelmingly voted in favor of making the vaccine available to children in this age group.\n\nKey points for parents and caregivers:\n\nEffectiveness: Immune responses of children 5 through 11 years of age were comparable to those of individuals 16 through 25 years of age. In addition, the vaccine was found to be 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19 in children 5 through 11.\n\nSafety: The vaccine's safety was studied in approximately 3,100 children age 5 through 11 who received the vaccine and no serious side effects have been detected in the ongoing study.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will meet next week to discuss further clinical recommendations.\n\n\"As a mother and a physician, I know that parents, caregivers, school staff, and children have been waiting for today's authorization. Vaccinating younger children against COVID-19 will bring us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy,\" said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. \"Our comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the data pertaining to the vaccine's safety and effectiveness should help assure parents and guardians that this vaccine meets our high standards.\"\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children 5 through 11 years of age is administered as a two-dose primary series, 3 weeks apart, but is a lower dose (10 micrograms) than that used for individuals 12 years of age and older (30 micrograms).\n\nIn the U.S., COVID-19 cases in children 5 through 11 years of age make up 39% of cases in individuals younger than 18 years of age. According to the CDC, approximately 8,300 COVID-19 cases in children 5 through 11 years of age resulted in hospitalization. As of Oct. 17, 691 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported in the U.S. in individuals less than 18 years of age, with 146 deaths in the 5 through 11 years age group.\n\n\"The FDA is committed to making decisions that are guided by science that the public and healthcare community can trust. We are confident in the safety, effectiveness and manufacturing data behind this authorization. As part of our commitment to transparency around our decision-making, which included our public advisory committee meeting earlier this week, we have posted documents today supporting our decision and additional information detailing our evaluation of the data will be posted soon. We hope this information helps build confidence of parents who are deciding whether to have their children vaccinated,\" said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\n\nThe FDA has determined this Pfizer vaccine has met the criteria for emergency use authorization. Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, the known and potential benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in individuals down to 5 years of age outweigh the known and potential risks.\n\nFDA Evaluation of Available Effectiveness Data\n\nThe effectiveness data to support the EUA in children down to 5 years of age is based on an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled study that has enrolled approximately 4,700 children 5 through 11 years of age. The study is being conducted in the U.S., Finland, Poland and Spain. Children in the vaccine group received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine containing 10 micrograms of messenger RNA per dose. The FDA analyzed data that compared the immune response of 264 participants from this study to 253 participants 16 through 25 years of age who had two higher doses of the vaccine in a previous study which determined the vaccine to be effective in preventing COVID-19. The immune responses of the younger age participants were comparable to the older participants.\n\nThe FDA also conducted a preliminary analysis of cases of COVID-19 occurring seven days after the second dose. In this analysis, among participants without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, 3 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 1,305 vaccine recipients and 16 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 663 placebo recipients; the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19.\n\nFDA Evaluation of Available Safety Data\n\nThe available safety data to support the EUA include more than 4,600 participants (3,100 vaccine, 1,538 placebo) ages 5 through 11 years enrolled in the ongoing study. In this trial, a total of 1,444 vaccine recipients were followed for safety for at least 2 months after the second dose.\n\nCommonly reported side effects in the clinical trial included injection site pain (sore arm), redness and swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle and/or joint pain, chills, fever, swollen lymph nodes, nausea and decreased appetite. More children reported side effects after the second dose than after the first dose. Side effects were generally mild to moderate in severity and occurred within two days after vaccination, and most went away within one to two days.\n\nThe FDA and CDC safety surveillance systems have previously identified increased risks of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of tissue surrounding the heart) following vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, particularly following the second dose, and with the observed risk highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Therefore, the FDA conducted its own benefit-risk assessment using modelling to predict how many symptomatic COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths from COVID-19 the vaccine in children 5 through 11 years of age would prevent versus the number of potential myocarditis cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths that the vaccine might cause. The FDA's model predicts that overall, the benefits of the vaccine would outweigh its risks in children 5 through 11 years of age.\n\nOngoing Safety Monitoring\n\nPfizer Inc. has updated its safety monitoring plan to include evaluation of myocarditis, pericarditis and other events of interest in children 5 through 11 years of age. In addition, the FDA and the CDC have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety and allow for the rapid detection and investigation of potential safety problems.\n\nIt is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report to any serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death in vaccinated individuals. It is also mandatory for vaccination providers to report all vaccine administration errors to VAERS for which they become aware and for Pfizer Inc. to include a summary and analysis of all identified vaccine administration errors in monthly safety reports to the FDA."}

For years, the president has used his Twitter account to reach his nearly 90 million now-former followers on the platform as a means to bypass traditional media. Many critics have long argued that Twitter should take a firmer stance against Trump due to his dangerous use of the platform to spread lies and violent rhetoric.\n\nWhile some may see the move as too little, too late, and Trump's supporters are questioning it entirely, it nevertheless marks a historic exertion of Twitter's ability to influence politics during a time when the strength of democracy in the US is being seriously tested.\n\n\"In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action,\" read a company blog post on Friday explaining the decision. Despite the fact that Twitter has generally allowed world leaders like Trump to post more controversial content than the average user since their tweets are deemed newsworthy, the company said that these accounts are still \"not above our rules entirely and cannot use Twitter to incite violence, among other things.\"\n\nAhead of the permanent ban, Twitter had previously temporarily suspended Trump's tweets on Wednesday for violating its policies on civic integrity and violence, and warned that it may permanently suspend him if he continued to violate its policies. Now, users can no longer see Trump's tweets, and the president is unable to post on his account.\n\nThe move comes as hundreds of Twitter's own employees urged CEO Jack Dorsey to suspend Trump permanently, according to a report by the Washington Post.\n\nThe day before Twitter's permanent suspension, Facebook blocked Trump's account on its platform, which has tens of millions of followers, from posting and emphasized that the ban would be in place for at least two weeks until President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.\n\nRecent events leading to the decision\n\nTwitter's official explanation for why it permanently blocked Trump's account was that his last two tweets violated the company's Glorification of Violence policy and were part of a broader pattern of encouraging violence during the transition of presidential powers. Twitter specifically cited a concern that Trump's followers seemed to interpret his announcement about not attending Biden's inauguration as a signal that it would be a \"safe\" target for violent acts.\n\nThe first tweet that pushed Trump past Twitter's tipping point stated that he would not attend Joe Biden's inauguration. The second declared that the \"75,000,000 great American Patriots\" who voted for Trump would not be \"disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!\""}

At first Darwich was skeptical of the other gas station owners who were calling him with news of a strange computer hack attack on Colonial Pipeline, the company that ran the network of fuel pipes serving much of the East Coast. The pipeline had been shut down, and panicked drivers were buying extra fuel, leading to a run on gas supplies.\n\n\"I didn't believe it,\" he said in a recent phone interview. \"There's no way in hell something like this would happen in the United States.\"\n\nBut it was true. On May 12, five days after an employee in Colonial's control room discovered the hack, Darwich's pumps ran dry. He desperately called his supplier, who told him the only thing he could do was wait. Darwich wasn't the only one who needed gas: Thousands of stations in a dozen states were in the same bind.\n\n\"For more than a month I did not see my customers,\" he said. \"It hurt a lot.\"\n\nNow he's suing Colonial Pipeline over those lost sales, accusing it of lax security. He and his lawyers are hoping to also represent the hundreds of other small gas stations that were hurt by the hack. It's just one of several class-action lawsuits that are popping up in the wake of high-profile ransomware attacks.\n\nAnother lawsuit filed against Colonial in Georgia in May seeks damages for consumers who had to pay higher gas prices. A third is in the works, with law firm Chimicles Schwartz Kriner & Donaldson-Smith LLP pursuing a similar effort.\n\nAnd Colonial isn't the only company being sued. San Diego-based hospital system Scripps Health is facing class-action lawsuits stemming from a ransomware attack in April.\n\nCybersecurity lapses at major companies have led to class-action lawsuits and settlements in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Retailer Target paid $10 million to consumers and $39 million to banks after hackers broke into its systems and stole personal information in 2013. Home Depot brokered a similar settlement with shoppers who had their credit card information stolen from the home improvement store's computers.\n\nBut ransomware attacks have the potential to affect people in ways that go far beyond having their personal information stolen and sold online.\n\nRansomware hackers deploy software that locks the owner of the targeted computer system out of their machines, and demands a cryptocurrency payment in return for handing back control.\n\nIn a world where everything runs on computers, these attacks can cause havoc. Hospitals have had to postpone surgeries. In Southern Maryland, Leonardtown was hit by the sprawling Kaseya IT software hack and lost 17 of its 19 computers, forcing it to stop billing residents for electricity and blocking paychecks from going out to town employees. And in the case of Colonial Pipeline, hundreds of gas stations were shut down, leading to huge lines of cars waiting for what little fuel remained.\n\nThe rise in lawsuits may mean companies and organizations that are hacked are no longer just on the hook for reimbursing people who had their data stolen. They could now be liable for all kinds of damages that go well beyond a heightened risk of identity theft or credit card fraud.\n\n\"This is an extremely developing and increasing area,\" said John Yanchunis, a veteran class-action lawyer with Morgan & Morgan who worked on data breach lawsuits against Yahoo, Equifax and Target. His firm is involved in the lawsuit against Colonial that seeks to represent gas station owners."}

Ransomware gangs were shockingly aggressive, targeting health care facilities, schools, and critical infrastructure at an alarming rate. And hackers continued to launch supply chain attacks with extensive fallout. With the pandemic still raging in the background, system administrators, incident responders, global law enforcement, and security practitioners of all sorts worked tirelessly to counter the barrage. And governments scrambled to take more concrete action against online threats.\n\nFor now, though, the seemingly endless cat-and-mouse game continues. As John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, puts it, \"2021 is the year where we're realizing that the problems we chose not to solve years or decades ago are one by one coming back to haunt us.\"\n\nHere's WIRED's retrospective on the year's worst breaches, leaks, data exposures, ransomware attacks, state-sponsored hacking campaigns, and digital mayhem. With no sign of a reprieve in 2022, watch your back and stay safe out there.\n\nIn early May, ransomware hit Colonial Pipeline, which operates a 5,500-mile pipeline that carries nearly half of the East Coast's fuel—gasoline, diesel, and natural gas—from Texas all the way to New Jersey. As a result of the attack, the company shut down portions of the pipeline both to contain the malware and because the attack knocked its billing systems offline. As lines grew at gas stations through the southeastern US, the Department of Transportation released an emergency order to allow expanded fuel distribution by truck. The FBI also named the notorious Russia-linked ransomware gang DarkSide as the perpetrator of the attack.\n\nColonial Pipelines paid a 75 bitcoin ransom—worth more than $4 million at the time—in an attempt to resolve the incident. Law enforcement was later able to recover some of the funds, and DarkSide went underground to avoid scrutiny. In November, the State Department announced a $10 million bounty for substantive information about the group's ringleaders. The attack was one of the largest-ever disruptions of US critical infrastructure by hackers, and was part of a series of alarming hacks in 2021 that finally seem to have served as a wakeup call for the US government and its allies about the need to comprehensively address and deter ransomware attacks."}

And I want to provide the American people with a brief update and the — on the situation in Afghanistan.\n\nSince I spoke to you on Monday, we've made significant progress. We have secured the airport, enabling flights to resume. Not just military flights, but civilian charters and other — from other countries and the NGOs taking out civilians and vulnerable Afghan — vulnerable Afghans.\n\nAnd now we have almost 6,000 troops on the ground, including the 82nd Airborne providing runway security, the Army 10th Mountain Division standing guard around the airport, and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit assisting the civilian departure.\n\nThis is one of the largest, most difficult airlifts in history.

Here's what the Taliban takeover means for al-Qaeda and the Islamic State's Afghanistan affiliate.\n\nU.S. officials blamed an Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan for twin blasts outside Kabul's airport Thursday, and President Biden pledged to track down leaders of the group who ordered the attack. The explosions left dozens dead or injured, including U.S. military personnel and Afghan civilians. Crowds have thronged the airport since the Taliban took over Kabul on Aug. 15, and U.S. intelligence officials had anticipated the Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K) could strike amid the chaos.\n\nThe Islamic State released a statement Thursday claiming responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe ISIS offshoot is a more extreme rival of the Taliban. Experts say the Taliban is likely to try to root out the group. But some warned earlier this month that ISIS-K could benefit from a security vacuum as the Taliban tries to consolidate power.\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal was based on the conclusion that terrorist groups would no longer be able to use the country to stage attacks on the United States.\n\n\"We went to Afghanistan almost 20 years ago with clear goals — get those who attacked us on September 11th, 2001, and make sure al-Qaeda could not use Afghanistan as a base from which to attack us again,\" President Biden said in remarks from the White House last week defending the pullout of American forces after the Afghan government's swift collapse. \"We did that.\"\n\nBut the bloody scenes outside the airport Thursday have underscored the ongoing terrorism threat in Afghanistan, where al-Qaeda also continues to operate.\n\nWhile al-Qaeda has been substantially weakened since 2001 — and the Taliban has committed to preventing it from attacking the United States and its allies — al-Qaeda fighters remain in Afghanistan and have hailed the Taliban takeover.\n\nThe Taliban has said it would not allow al-Qaeda or other terrorist groups to launch attacks from the country. But outside observers say the Taliban maintains ties to al-Qaeda.\n\nHere's where the Islamic State and al-Qaeda stand in Afghanistan.\n\nWhat is al-Qaeda's relationship to the Taliban, and how strong is the group?\n\nThe first time the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, from 1996 to 2001, it sheltered al-Qaeda militants who plotted the 9/11 attacks on the United States. The U.S.-led coalition invaded Afghanistan in 2001 with the aim of crushing the extremist group.\n\nAfter two decades of conflict and counterterrorism operations, \"al-Qaeda in Afghanistan is a skeleton of its former self,\" said Fawaz Gerges, a professor at the London School of Economics. He said the group lacks charismatic leadership and is \"starved financially.\"\n\nA recent U.N. report said al-Qaeda maintained a presence in at least 15 Afghan provinces. An offshoot, al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, has operated \"under the Taliban umbrella\" from Kandahar, Helmand and Nimruz provinces, according to the United Nations. In total, al-Qaeda members are estimated to number between several dozen and 500 people.\n\nMohammad Naeem, a Taliban spokesman, denied the presence of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan in an interview with Saudi Arabia's al-Hadath TV that aired Sunday. He said the extremist group had no foothold in the country and no relationship with the Taliban, though there may be \"family ties\" between members of the two organizations.\n\nBut a recent U.N. report said al-Qaeda showed \"no indication of breaking ties\" with the Taliban, with ideological alignment and personal relationships, including intermarriage, keeping the groups close.\n\nAfghanistan analyst Abdul Sayed characterized the relationship as \"cordial and stronger than in the pre-9/11 period.\"\n\nThough the Taliban has \"begun to tighten its control\" over al-Qaeda, the United Nations said in the spring, \"it is impossible to assess with confidence that the Taliban will live up to its commitment to suppress any future international threat emanating from Al-Qaida in Afghanistan.\"\n\nWhat presence does the Islamic State have in Afghanistan?\n\nISIS-K began operating in Afghanistan in 2015, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nStarted by Pakistani national Hafiz Saeed Khan, who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State's then-head Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2014, it began as a small band of mostly Pakistani militants operating in the eastern Afghanistan province of Nangahar. Some recruits came from the Taliban, though members of other extremist groups in the region also defected to the Khorasan group, according to the CSIS report.\n\nLike its parent group — the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria — the Afghanistan offshoot has ambitions to hold territory and is known for carrying out brutal attacks on civilians. Shiites are particularly frequent targets.\n\nU.N. Secretary General António Guterres warned in 2019 that after the Islamic State lost its territory in Iraq and Syria, its umbrella group in Afghanistan had access to hundreds of millions of dollars to finance terrorism.\n\nISIS-K has never successfully captured territory in Afghanistan. Instead, its strategy has centered on attacking civilian targets such as mosques, schools and weddings.\n\nThe number of attacks it has carried out annually has decreased in recent years. During the first four months of this year, the United Nations. recorded 77 attacks associated with the group. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the bombing of a school for girls in Kabul in May that killed more than 85 people, mostly students.\n\nU.S. airstrikes took out key leaders of the Islamic State Khorasan, including its founder, early on. And in 2017, the U.S. military dropped the \"mother of all bombs\" on a cave where fighters were hiding in Nangahar province.\n\nStill, the affiliate group has managed to sustain itself. The United Nations estimates that it retains a core group of some 1,500 to 2,200 fighters in Konar and Nangahar provinces, with smaller cells scattered throughout the country.\n\nWhat threats do the Islamic State and al-Qaeda pose in Afghanistan?\n\nMost analysts agree that al-Qaeda lacks the strength and capability to pose an immediate threat to the United States.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that al-Qaeda's capacity to attack the United States or its allies is \"vastly diminished,\" though he acknowledged that \"remnants\" of the group remained in Afghanistan.\n\nBut given the chance that al-Qaeda will acquire a sanctuary under the Taliban — and the complications to counterterrorism operations that the Taliban victory poses — some say the group could reconstitute itself."}

It's not known how long it will take to clear the backlog of more than 300 ships waiting to enter the canal.\n\nA canal official said it would take three days while data company Refinitiv estimated it could be 10 days or more.\n\nThe disruption costs the canal as much as $15 billion per day, according to Suez Canal Authority chairman Osama Rabie, the BBC reported.\n\nHow they got the ship out of the Suez Canal:\n\nThe ship's stern was freed first Sunday, and the bow was removed from the canal bank Monday. The canal authority said the ship \"came out intact and it has no problems.\"\n\nAs conventional earthmoving equipment worked on shore, tugboats and dredgers were busy in the water.\n\nDredgers clawed away underwater sand\n\nDredgers are ships equipped with machines to remove underwater sand and sediment. Material can be lifted to the surface with bucket-like devices or vacuumed up by hydraulic pumps.\n\nTwo dredgers played an important role in refloating the container ship: the 10th of Ramadan and the Mashhour, both owned by the Suez Canal Authority.\n\nThe Mashhour is reported to be the largest and most powerful cutter suction dredger in the world. It was used to widen and deepen sections of the Suez Canal in previous operations.\n\nTugboats pushed, pulled ship free\n\nTugboats are powerful, specialized craft that essentially help ships \"park\" in ports and assist larger ships in moving in and out of berths. They can push or rotate ships by direct contact or pull them with heavy cables called tow lines.\n\nLarge ships, such as the Ever Given, have reinforced hull areas designed for tugboat pushing.\n\nTugboats are used in ports because large ships can't precisely maneuver in tight spots at low speeds. They can guide ships safely through narrow passages.\n\nAbout 14 tugboats of varying sizes were used to free the Ever Given, the BBC reported.\n\nHigh tides made a critical difference in freeing the ship\n\nSalvagers were aided by a full moon and high tides within the canal. The full moon offers spring tides, or king tides, which are higher and lower than average, The Associated Press reported.\n\nGravity has a greater effect on tides during the straight-line alignment of the Earth, the moon and the sun.\n\nThe spring high tides added a few inches of water inside the canal, making removal easier.\n\nHow many ships are waiting?\n\nSatellite imagery shows ships jammed up around the Suez Canal.

After receiving data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) in late March, the IRS was able to start processing third stimulus payments for approximately 30 million seniors. These people will generally get their stimulus payment in the same way they get their regular Social Security benefits. Since most of these payments will be paid electronically through direct deposits or to existing Direct Express debit cards, the funds have already been delivered to many of these seniors. For those still waiting, more payments will arrive this week and in the following weeks.\n\nThird stimulus payments are generally based on information found on your 2019 or 2020 tax return. That's why many people who receive Social Security benefits and filed a 2019 or 2020 return, or who used the IRS's Non-Filers tool last year, received a third stimulus check in March. However, since some Social Security recipients don't file tax returns, the IRS didn't have the necessary information in its computer systems to process third-round stimulus payments for them. That's why the tax agency needed data from the SSA to send out checks to seniors who haven't file a recent tax return.\n\nIn addition to seniors receiving Social Security retirement benefits, payments are also being sent to people receiving Social Security disability (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) benefits who didn't file a 2019 or 2020 tax return or didn't use the Non-Filers tool. Veterans who receive benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs but didn't file a recent tax return should start getting third-round stimulus payments soon, too.\n\nMost Social Security, SSDI, SSI, and RRB beneficiaries who are eligible for a third stimulus check don't need to take any action to receive a payment (not everyone is eligible). However, as with previous stimulus payments, some beneficiaries may need to file a 2020 tax return – even if they don't usually file – to provide the IRS the information it needs to send an additional $1,400 for a spouse or any dependents. The deadline for filing a 2020 tax return has been pushed back from April 15 to May 17, 2021.\n\nAmount of Your Third Stimulus Check\n\nEvery eligible American will receive a $1,400 third stimulus check \"base amount.\" The base amount jumps to $2,800 for married couples filing a joint tax return. You also get an extra $1,400 for each dependent in your family (regardless of the dependent's age)."}

As the first round of vaccine recipients become eligible to receive their second dose, we want to remind the public about the importance of receiving COVID-19 vaccines according to how they've been authorized by the FDA in order to safely receive the level of protection observed in the large randomized trials supporting their effectiveness.\n\nWe have been following the discussions and news reports about reducing the number of doses, extending the length of time between doses, changing the dose (half-dose), or mixing and matching vaccines in order to immunize more people against COVID-19. These are all reasonable questions to consider and evaluate in clinical trials. However, at this time, suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence. Without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from COVID-19.\n\nThe available data continue to support the use of two specified doses of each authorized vaccine at specified intervals. For the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, the interval is 21 days between the first and second dose. And for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the interval is 28 days between the first and second dose.\n\nWhat we have seen is that the data in the firms' submissions regarding the first dose is commonly being misinterpreted. In the phase 3 trials, 98% of participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech trial and 92% of participants in the Moderna trial received two doses of the vaccine at either a three- or four-week interval, respectively. Those participants who did not receive two vaccine doses at either a three-or four-week interval were generally only followed for a short period of time, such that we cannot conclude anything definitive about the depth or duration of protection after a single dose of vaccine from the single dose percentages reported by the companies.\n\nUsing a single dose regimen and/or administering less than the dose studied in the clinical trials without understanding the nature of the depth and duration of protection that it provides is concerning, as there is some indication that the depth of the immune response is associated with the duration of protection provided. If people do not truly know how protective a vaccine is, there is the potential for harm because they may assume that they are fully protected when they are not, and accordingly, alter their behavior to take unnecessary risks.\n\nWe know that some of these discussions about changing the dosing schedule or dose are based on a belief that changing the dose or dosing schedule can help get more vaccine to the public faster.

The defendant. It's white supremacy in action,' ranted Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO) on Twitter\n\nA jury acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse of all charges related to the shooting of three men in Kenosha, Wisconsin in the August 2020\n\nDemocrats, the liberal media and Hollywood exploded over a jury's decision to acquit Kyle Rittenhouse of all charges related to the August 2020 shootings of three men in Kenosha, Wisconsin.\n\n'The judge. The jury. The defendant. It's white supremacy in action,' ranted Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO) on Twitter.\n\n'This system isn't built to hold white supremacists accountable,' she tweeted.\n\n'It's why Black and brown folks are brutalized and put in cages while white supremacist murderers walk free. I'm hurt. I'm angry. I'm heartbroken', Bush concluded.\n\nIt's more of the same from America's political left, which has been smearing Rittenhouse as a 'white supremacist,' 'domestic terrorist,' vigilante and a murderer for months on end.\n\nNow they're turning their ire on 'the system'.\n\nBut apparently, they haven't learned from their mistakes -- as top Democrats continue to repeat outright falsehoods about the case.\n\n'Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum are victims. They should be alive today,' blurted out deeply unpopular, uber-liberal New York City mayor Bill de Blasio on Twitter, referencing the two men killed by Rittenhouse.\n\n'The only reason they're not is because a violent, dangerous man chose to take a gun across state lines and start shooting people. To call this a miscarriage of justice is an understatement,' he declared, repeating a false claim that anyone with even passing familiarity with the case would know.\n\nRittenhouse did not cross state lines with a weapon. This falsehood was refuted by Illinois county officials in October 2020 and by courtroom testimony.\n\nDe Blasio seemed to excuse his ignorance by tweeting: 'The far-right trolls who think it makes a difference whether a violent gunman got his weapon before or after he crossed state lines are missing the point: two people are dead and their killer is left unaccountable. That's not justice and they know it.'\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, also misinformed his nearly 500,000 followers.\n\nNadler tweeted, 'This heartbreaking verdict is a miscarriage of justice and sets a dangerous precedent which justifies federal review by DOJ. Justice cannot tolerate armed persons crossing state lines looking for trouble while people engage in First Amendment-protected protest'.\n\nProgressive 'Squad' leader, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) claimed that the jury's decision is an indictment of the U.S. judicial system.\n\n'What we are witnessing is a system functioning as designed and protecting those it was designed for,' is what she decided to blast out to her nearly 13 million Twitter followers.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochu (D) added this to the discourse: 'Kyle Rittenhouse used an assault weapon to kill two people. This is not justice,' she claimed in part.\n\nAll of these declarations from elected-Democrats clashing head-on with remarks from President Joe Biden.\n\n'I stand by with the jury as the jury system has concluded,' he told reporters Friday afternoon as he returned to the White House.\n\n'The jury system works and you have to abide by it.'\n\nActress Rachel Zegler leading the charge for Hollywood tweeting, 'kyle rittenhouse being acquitted on all charges after such heinous heinous crimes is the epitome of white privilege and exactly what is wrong with this godforsaken country.'\n\n'Justice denied is a body blow to our national psyche,' claimed Star Trek actor-turned activist George Takei."}

He had delivered an electrifying first-half performance, paving the way for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 31-26 victory over the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship.\n\nBut when asked about the magnitude of his accomplishment -- leading Tampa Bay to its first Super Bowl since 2002 -- and his decision to bet on himself and the Bucs, Brady preferred to deflect.\n\n\"This is an ultimate team sport,\" Brady said. \"We've had a lot of people work hard over a course of time to get to this point. It's a tough journey to get here, so to go on the road, win another road playoff game is a great achievement.\"\n\nAgain, Brady was asked about his journey, from face of the six-time world champion New England Patriots for 20 years to hitting the reset button with a previously 7-9 team that had the NFC's longest playoff drought. But he kept focusing on everybody else.\n\nHe praised head coach Bruce Arians and his coordinators, Byron Leftwich, Todd Bowles and Keith Armstrong. He praised the young playmakers on both sides of the ball.\n\n\"It has taken a lot of people on all sides of the ball to come through ... just an incredible journey for all of us,\" Brady reiterated. \"And I'm proud to be a part of it.\"\n\nBrady's responses came from a place of appreciation. Because here he is, in the twilight of his career, nearly a year after the coach and team he gave his heart and soul to for two decades no longer valued what he had to offer, taking for granted how he elevated those around him. And here he is, 43 years old and surrounded by everything he could have ever asked for:\n\nAn organization that craved him so much they kicked their former first overall pick to the curb to make room for him.\n\nA head coach who greatly respects him and offensive coordinator who welcomes his input.\n\nAn offense full of talent rather than New England's bare cupboard -- an offense full of deficiencies that Brady was asked to compensate for by his former coach.\n\nA game-changing defense that could ease the load and at times clean up the messes that he made.\n\nAs perfect as Brady has been for the Bucs, they have been just as perfect for him.\n\nBrady wasn't ready to be put out to pasture, as it seemed Bill Belichick desired in those latter years in Foxborough. The quarterback still loved the game too much, still had too much left to prove and still wanted to win. That's why he was willing to put himself through the arduous task of starting from scratch as he entered a 21st NFL season.\n\nTampa's players and coaches afforded him the opportunity to achieve all of his goals. And he would be able to pursue each without having to do it all on his own.\n\nOf course that didn't mean Brady took his foot off the accelerator. He continued to work just as hard and demand just as much. He set a tone for the Bucs, who are hungry to taste true success for the first time in many of the players' careers.\n\n\"He's at the helm, he's our leader and he's the reason why we're as good as we are,\" wide receiver Scotty Miller said. This season, Miller more than doubled his production from a year ago and on Sunday caught one of three Brady touchdown passes. \"He makes it easy to get behind him. His composure. We know he's going to get it done. He had a couple picks, but we know when the game is on the line, he's going to make a play.\""}

Some creditors promptly returned $400 million of the mistakenly wired money, but 10 others refused to return $500 million. The dispute ended up in court.\n\nYesterday, unexpectedly, a New York federal judge said the firms could keep the cash, despite acknowledging that the money had been transferred in error.\n\nWait, what? The lenders argued that the transfers matched what they were owed, so they could have \"reasonably thought the payments were intentional,\" assuming that it would be \"downright irrational\" for Citi to make such a big mistake, the judge, Jesse Furman, concluded. He might have ruled differently if he could \"write on a blank slate,\" but there were legal precedents supporting the defendants.\n\n\"New York law wants to discourage banks from making these kinds of mistakes,\" said Adam Abensohn of Quinn Emanuel, who represented the asset managers. \"It's one thing to mistakenly send money to someone with no entitlement to that payment,\" he told DealBook. \"But there is nothing unfair about keeping that money when it's owed.\"\n\n\"At its heart, this case involves a clash between two basic intuitive principles,\" the judge said:\n\n\"If one party sends money to another by mistake, the latter should generally be required to give it back.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, if one party owes money to another and pays that money back to the penny, the latter should generally be allowed to keep and use the money as it wishes, without fear that the former will develop a case of borrower's remorse and claim that the payment was by mistake.\"\n\nWhere do you stand? The decision — which Citi will probably appeal — raises thorny questions about rules versus principles:\n\nSince it was a mistake by the bank, why not return the money?\n\nWhat responsibility do creditors have to the bank if it pays them back early?\n\nThis has generated a fascinating debate here at DealBook, and we'd like to hear what you think: Email us at dealbook@nytimes.com.

This is significant progress, made possible by a vaccinations program that made shots free and convenient for months. But more vaccinations are needed to save lives, protect the economy, and accelerate the path out of the pandemic. To that end, in July, President Biden began rolling out vaccination requirements for federal employees and contractors and calling on employers to do the same. Thousands of organizations across the country have answered the President's call, and vaccination requirements have already helped reduce the number of unvaccinated Americans by approximately 40 percent since July.\n\nToday, the Biden Administration is announcing the details of two policies to fight COVID-19 that will drive even more progress and result in millions of Americans getting vaccinated, protecting workers, preventing hospitalization, saving lives, and strengthening the economy.\n\nFirst, the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is announcing the details of a requirement for employers with 100 or more employees to ensure each of their workers is fully vaccinated or tests for COVID-19 on at least a weekly basis. The OSHA rule will also require that these employers provide paid-time for employees to get vaccinated, and ensure all unvaccinated workers wear a face mask in the workplace. OSHA has a strong 50-year record of requiring employers to take common sense actions to prevent workers from getting sick or injured on the job. This rule will cover 84 million employees.\n\nSecond, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) at the Department of Health and Human Services is announcing the details of its requirement that health care workers at facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid are fully vaccinated. The rule applies to more than 17 million workers at approximately 76,000 health care facilities, including hospitals and long-term care facilities."}

Tanks are getting refilled, lines gone. Motorists are no longer panic hoarding and kicking themselves for not buying that plug-in Tesla TSLA . It may take a little longer to lose that sneaking suspicion that civilization is on shakier foundations than we thought.\n\nAnd it's cold comfort that the DarkSide hackers are \"apolitical\" and didn't intend to cause social havoc, says Jonathan Reiber of AttackIQ. Because attacks like this broaden the imagination. Now that other groups see what's possible they will try the same thing — but with more malevolent intent. And they'll ask for a lot more than the $5 million that DarkSide allegedly extracted from Colonial.\n\n\"Five million is nothing to them,\" agrees Mark Ostrowski, head of engineering at CheckPoint, who was impressed by reports that Colonial had backups from which it was able to recover the 100 gigabytes of exfiltrated data more quickly than by decrypting with the hackers' recovery key. Indeed \"five million is not a lot given the damage to reputation and productivity that was caused,\" says James Reynolds, chief product officer at SecureAge. \"They could have easily required 10 times that.\"\n\nAnd Colonial could have paid it. According to financial results filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Colonial Pipeline Company has $3.1 billion of assets (against $2.6 billion of long-term debt) and generated net income of $420 million last year on $1.3 billion of revenues. Over just the past two years the company has distributed $820 million in dividends to its owners, including Koch Capital Investments, Shell Midstream, and three institutional investors. The Koch family, led by Charles, 85, controls a 28% stake in the pipeline company. Forbes estimates their net worth at $100 billion.\n\nThere is no amount of investment in cyber security that Colonial Pipeline cannot afford, and no excuses really for this kind of cyber breach, say experts. Indeed we've reached a point where the cost of an infrastructure giant not adequately preparing for \"black swan\" risks is often far higher to society than it is to the company that got hacked. Jennifer Bisceglie, CEO and founder of Interos marvels at the string of disasters of recent months — Solarwinds SWI , the Texas power grid collapse, the clogging of the Suez canal. \"And now I have to stay home because I can't get gas because someone hacked a pipeline,\" she says. To top it off, Chick-fil-A is suffering a sauce shortage.\n\nHow can these things be allowed to happen in our postmodern economy? Too much just-in-time interconnection, not enough attention paid to resilience, says Bisceglie. Some of the most successful attacks begin by infiltrating the person who supplies the person who supplies you — making it every company's responsibility to continuously map all their connections and proactively develop back-ups. \"Not knowing is not ok anymore. Black swans are now examples of poor planning on your part,\" she says. Interos offers clients tools for enterprise resilience, including A.I.-informed scenario planning and deep analysis of supply-chain connections.\n\nThreats have been evolving for a decade, and the industry has matured, says Jonathan Reiber of AttackIQ. Far from being just the domain of pariah states for whom the internet represents an assymetric force multiplier, hacker tools are everywhere. On the dark web you can rent denial-of-service-as-a-service.\n\nWith the exponential increase in the number of attack surfaces, the problem is only going to get worse. In the past year millions went to work from home, and now find themselves living in an online world with near-seamless connections between software apps for work, entertainment, banking, investments. \"Cyber created a world without a perimeter that is now extended into our living room,\" and interacting with us via A.I. helpers like Alexa, says Bisceglie.\n\nMark Ostrowski, head of engineering at CheckPoint Software says chief information security officers must introduce so-called \"zero-trust\" architecture — in which not even devices and actors operating within a cybersecurity perimeter are considered safe, requiring multiple login protocols for any device attempting to connect to a system. And you need a security overlay sitting in front of your digital environment that is checking every link, every email, watching how devices are talking to each other, and being constantly updated."}

The Duke of Sussex travelled from his home in California to make the family event, and was pictured speaking to his brother, Prince William, on the way out of St George's Chapel in Windsor.\n\nHarry's wife Meghan Markle, meanwhile, had to stay behind in the US, being heavily pregnant with a baby daughter who is due in June or July. After initially announcing their pregnancy on Valentine's Day this year, the Sussexes revealed it was a little girl they were expecting during their interview with Oprah Winfrey. Now, the couple will be planning what to call their baby girl, and there has been some speculation on social media that they might opt for a name that honours both Queen Elizabeth and the late Prince Philip.\n\nThe Queen has a nickname that was only used by her parents and by her husband, Prince Philip: Lilibet. It was believed to have come about after a young Elizabeth couldn't pronounce her own name, and it stuck throughout the years. In fact, Queen Elizabeth's father, King George VI, once famously said about his two daughters: \"Lilibet is my pride. Margaret is my joy.\"\n\nBecause this was a name the Duke of Edinburgh used right up until the end, some people feel that Meghan and Harry might consider a shorter version - Lily - for their unborn child as a sweet, indirect tribute to both of Prince Harry's paternal grandparents.\n\nThe suggestion has featured numerous times on Twitter and in different Reddit threads about possible Meghan and Harry baby names. \"I'm not sure how relationships are between the family, but Lily would be a cute way to honour the Queen (Lilibet),\" wrote one royal fan recently.\n\nThe idea was also put forward two years ago, just before Meghan gave birth to baby Archie and nobody knew whether they were expecting a boy or a girl. \"I read a prediction somewhere that they could use Lily for the Queen because of her childhood nickname Lilibet and because of Meghan's wedding bouquet being Lily of the valley. I think that's really sweet,\" posted a Reddit user.\n\nWhether or not Meghan and Harry will choose to go for something family-related for their daughter remains to be seen, but as always with a royal baby, the bookies have been placing odds on a certain few female baby names in particular.

He's consistently worked against [Trump] as a Republican against a Republican president. It doesn't get any worse than that,\" said Chris Mathys, the only Republican challenger in California's pro-Biden 21st Congressional District.\n\nEleven of the 17 Republicans who supported Trump's second impeachment -- the 10 representatives and one senator -- face voters again in 2022, and 10 of them are facing challengers from within their own party.\n\n\"This impeachment vote, to me, was simply the last straw in what has been a political career full of choices abandoning his duty to protect our Constitution and the people's individual liberties,\" said Jonah Schulz, who is challenging Ohio Rep. Anthony Gonzalez despite Trump throwing his weight behind a different candidate.\n\nCandidates don't file to get on the ballot with their state's department overseeing elections until an election year, but across the 11 races, 40 Republicans have filed candidacies with the Federal Election Commission, a requirement to raise and spend campaign cash.\n\nTo put that figure into perspective, in 2020, eight of the 10 Republicans ran as incumbents. Across those eight districts, only four non-incumbent Republicans were on the primary ballots.\n\nWhile not all of these campaigns will materialize -- some candidates don't even have a website or have raised little to no money -- several candidates are waging serious campaigns, and the kingmaker, Trump, has been sparing with his endorsements so far.\n\nIncumbents rarely lose primaries. In the post-World War II era, 98% of House members who sought reelection won their party's nomination, according to an analysis by Sabato's Crystal Ball. But Trump is a chronic disrupter of norms, and when it comes to the Republicans who defied him, he wants to \"get rid of them all,\" as he said at this year's Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nIf he makes his preferred candidate known, these primary races will test how firm the former president's grip still is on the GOP.\n\n\"When the former president, who is the most popular person in the Republican Party, is ... getting involved in some of these challenger races, that's not generally the case when you see challengers to incumbents,\" said Taylor Budowich, a senior adviser to Ohio congressional candidate Max Miller.\n\nMiller is one of two challengers Trump has already endorsed, and the former president is holding a rally outside Cleveland Saturday night to support him. A former White House staffer and veteran of the former president's campaigns, Miller is running against Gonzalez in Ohio's 16th Congressional District. Trump's endorsement -- received on the day he announced his campaign -- is prominently displayed on Miller's website.\n\nOf all the pro-impeachment Republicans, South Carolina Rep. Tom Rice is by far facing the most primary challengers -- 11 total. Voters in South Carolina's 7th Congressional District backed Trump over Biden by nearly 19 points, the second-largest margin among the pro-impeachment Republicans' districts."}

A spokesman for Brooks could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nHarrowing scenes from the U.S. Capitol siege\n\nBrooks and Trump are co-defendants in a lawsuit by Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell that accuses them of inciting people during a Jan. 6 rally to attack the Capitol and stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election victory.\n\nTrump is a defendant in two other similar lawsuits, one filed by Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson and another on behalf of two U.S. Capitol police officers.\n\nTrump has so far not publicly requested Justice Department protection in the case, nor has his attorney Jesse Binnall said whether he intends to ask the department to take a position.\n\nIn a statement, Binnall said: \"The Supreme Court has been clear that presidents cannot be sued for actions that are related to their duties of office. Addressing Americans about congressional action is a quintessential presidential duty.\"\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nThe department riled some Democrats, with a pair of recent decisions that seemed to shield Trump or members of his administration, though legal experts said the moves were intended to protect the office of the presidency, not its former occupant.\n\nTrump's primary legal defense in the Swalwell suit has not rested on the Westfall Act but on a legal doctrine that argues the separation of powers in the U.S. Constitution broadly grants the president immunity during his time in office.\n\n\"Rousing and controversial speeches are a key function of the presidency. That is especially true when, as is the case here, the President is advocating for or against congressional action,\" his lawyer wrote in a May 24 filing.\n\nIn a footnote, the lawyer added: \"Even if former President Trump is not covered by absolute immunity, as a governmental actor, the claims against him are also foreclosed by immunity under the Westfall Act.\"\n\nAttorney Anne Tindall of the advocacy group Protect Democracy said the department's filing contains a lot of signs that are \"bad news for Trump.\"\n\n\"Trump's role is even more limited than Brooks' is,\" said Tindall, who is representing two Capitol Police officers in a separate lawsuit alleging Trump incited the riot."}

Democrats are now calling on formal investigations, citing an unusual uptick in visitors sporting MAGA gear the day before the attempted coup. But few other details have been released.\n\n\"Let's be clear, there's no way those groups could have gotten into the Capitol without a Member of Congress or a staff member of a member of Congress,\" said U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat from New Jersey.\n\nCapitol riot arrests: See who has been charged\n\nHere's a breakdown of what we know so far:\n\nWhat's been alleged?\n\nSome members of Congress, including those who say they're trained to spot suspicious activity from their time in the military, said in a letter that they witnessed an usual number of outside groups visiting the complex on Jan. 5, the day before the riot. They allege some of those visitors may have been involved in the deadly insurrection the following day.\n\nThe letter, which demands that the House Sergeant at Arms, Senate Sergeant at Arms and Capitol Police investigate the link between those visitors and the subsequent violence in the Capitol, garnered more than 30 signatures.\n\nThose lawmakers say that the building has been mostly closed to the public since March 2020 and cited \"a concerning departure from the procedures\" the day before the riot. The letter also notes that these visitors appeared to be associated with the Trump rally, but offered no other details. It goes on to question whether there were any sign-ins, logbooks, video footage or facial recognition software available. The letter also questions the tracking involved for staff members who want to bring official guests into the building and which other agencies have potentially accessed these records.\n\nSome members of Congress grew suspicious because the only people who could have facilitated such tours, they contend, are fellow lawmakers. One Democrat said the emergency call buttons were removed from her office. Another said pipe bombs found earlier in the day were a clear diversionary tactic to get Capitol Police to leave the perimeter. Many have also questioned how the rioters knew their way around the maze of the Capitol so quickly and why only liberal offices appear to have been targeted.\n\n\"Stop the Steal\" organizer Ali Alexander further exacerbated these theories when he claimed that three Republican House members – Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar of Arizona and Mo Brooks of Alabama – had helped him plan the rally. Biggs and Brooks have explicitly denied a role. Gosar has not commented on his alleged involvement.\n\nWho is investigating?\n\nCongressional Democrats have asked the House Sergeant at Arms, Senate Sergeant at Arms and Capitol Police to investigate the link between the visitors and riots. It's unclear exactly where that status of that probe stands. Other agencies, including the FBI and Metropolitan Police, have helped with criminal investigations into the various individuals arrested, but it's unclear if they're examining the possible connections to GOP lawmakers.\n\nWho was involved in the tours?\n\nThe Democrats haven't named names, but some have suggested the visitors mostly consisted of Trump supporters, which would not necessarily be usual taken by itself. It's also not clear if they spotted individual members of Congress helping get anyone inside.\n\nU.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, told reporters in the Capitol Wednesday he'd heard names of lawmakers who gave tours but didn't want to say until he got verification. \"I don't want to throw any member under the bus,\" he said.\n\nFederal law and safety rules amid the coronavirus pandemic prohibit members of the public from entering the building. All public tours have been canceled since March 2020, and only lawmakers, staff, media and their guests with proper credentials are allowed in.\n\n\"Who's responsible for this thing?\" said Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minnesota. \"Because clearly, long before any speeches were being made down by the White House, something was already afoot up here.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Florida, said he did not see anything like what Rep. Sherrill and others have alleged, calling her allegations \"hard to believe.\"\n\n\"Congresswoman Sherrill's claims of a criminal conspiracy by unnamed members of Congress is startling and hard to believe,\" Buchanan said. \"If she has evidence that a member of Congress conducted 'reconnaissance tours' to help the rioters plan last week's attack she needs to release it immediately. I saw nothing of the kind when I was on the House floor that week and would be shocked to learn it was true.\"\n\nIs there evidence that rioters targeted Black lawmakers, Pelosi and other specific members?\n\nPictures and video show one rioter trotting through the halls of Congress with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's stolen lectern tucked under his arm. Another image shows a Trump supporter in her office with his feet kicked up on a desk."}

She is also the first graduate of a historically Black college and the first member of a Black sorority to do so.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor administered the oath. Sotomayor, the first woman of color to serve on the Supreme Court, previously administered the vice presidential oath to Biden in 2013.\n\nHarris used two Bibles in the ceremony. The first belonged to Regina Shelton, a family friend whom Harris viewed as a surrogate mother.

The second Bible was previously owned by the late Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first Black member of the Supreme Court and Harris' lifelong political role model.\n\nIn a recent interview with NPR's Scott Detrow, Harris reflected on the moment that she would take the oath of office as vice president. \"I will be thinking about my mother, who's looking down from heaven.

Nor are other claims in the tweet.\n\nThe tweet was posted on Friday, two days after a Capitol insurrection by a mob of Trump supporters sparked a new impeachment push from House Democrats. As of early Monday, it had more than 181,000 retweets and 725,000 likes. It says the following: \"For those wondering if it's worth impeaching him this time, it means he:\n\n1) loses his 200k+ pension for the rest of his life\n\n2) loses his 1 million dollar/year travel allowance\n\n3) loses lifetime full secret service detail\n\n4) loses his ability to run in 2024\"\n\nFacts First: The tweet is inaccurate in multiple ways.\n\n1) Trump would lose his post-presidency pension only if both the House voted to impeach him and then the Senate voted to remove him from office; impeachment itself, without removal, would not result in Trump being denied any benefits.\n\n2) The law makes clear that presidents who have lifetime Secret Service protection never get a $1 million travel allowance.\n\n3) It is unclear that Trump would lose lifetime Secret Service protection even if the Senate voted to remove him and prohibit him from running.\n\n4) Even a Senate vote to remove Trump would not prohibit him from running in 2024; for the Senate to ban him from the presidency, it would have to hold an additional vote on this question.\n\nThe post-presidency pension\n\nTrump would not lose his pension if the House impeached him for his role in inciting the insurrection – just as he didn't lose his pension when the House impeached him in 2019 over his effort to use the US' relationship with Ukraine for his own political ends. Rather, under the Former Presidents Act, he would lose his pension only if the Senate voted to convict him and remove him from office.\n\nLots of average citizens use the word \"impeachment\" to refer to impeachment and removal, so we're not bashing Costiloe for this common error, but the statement is incorrect.\n\nPresidents who have not been impeached and removed are entitled to a lifetime pension equivalent to the annual salary of a head of an executive department. For Trump, like predecessor President Barack Obama, that would indeed amount to more than $200,000 per year.\n\nRunning in 2024\n\nNeither a second House impeachment nor even a Senate vote to convict Trump and remove him from office would prevent him from running again, in 2024 or beyond.\n\nRather, after two-thirds of senators present voted to remove Trump, a simple majority of senators present would have to approve an additional vote to bar him from the presidency in the future.\n\nThe Senate could not skip the conviction-and-removal vote that requires two-thirds of senators and go straight to the simple-majority vote for future disqualification, Ross Garber, an impeachment and political investigations lawyer who teaches at Tulane Law School, told CNN."}

And with that, they'll have more information they can attribute the cause of the accident.

It's not getting signed by the judge.\n\n\"And investigators will determine what is needed to determine the accident, or the traffic collision.\"\n\nCar accident reconstruction experts told USA TODAY Sports that available evidence in the case indicated that Woods was not paying attention and had a \"very delayed response\" to the emergency when his vehicle, a Genesis GV80, left the road before crashing that day."}

The disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico that would morph into Hurricane Ida was days away from landfall.\n\n\"We were supposed to bring a barge down here to Port Fourchon to get loaded and get back out,\" Dryden said during a phone interview Tuesday. \"We were trying to get loaded and tried to get back out before the storm hit. Well, we got down here and it was raining and there were thunderstorms. We just didn't have enough time to get out.\"\n\nIda strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane as it churned toward Louisiana's southeast coast. The storm swept ashore near Port Fourchon about 11:55 a.m. Sunday packing 150-mph winds and a storm surge forecasters and local officials estimated was at least 12 feet.\n\nThere was nothing the Brittany Lynn's three-member crew could do except batten down the hatches and hope for the best, said Dryden, who is from Deridder.\n\n\"I definitely didn't want to be down here because I knew this area was close to getting a direct hit,\" he said. \"You couldn't see the debris flying through the air. We were tied up against a dock. There was a trailer of offices out there about 600 feet from us and you couldn't see it during the storm. When the winds died down you could see right through that trailer. The walls were gone.\"\n\nAs the boat rocked against Ida's ferocious 150 mph winds, the unthinkable happened, Dryden said.\n\n\"At one point there when the eye was just about to come over us, there were some boats that got loose and hit our barges that we were tied to, which broke us loose,\" he said. \"I was looking at my chart system and could tell we were starting to move. I said to the head captain, 'We broke loose, man. Those boats behind us done hit us and broke us loose.' \"\n\nIt was the only time during the harrowing ordeal that Dryden said he was scared.\n\n\"The only time I got really worried was when we broke loose,\" he said. \"When it broke our barges loose and we went across the canal, I couldn't tell which way we were going. All I could tell is that we were moving. I didn't know if we were going to have to abandon the ship or what was fixing to happen.\"\n\nIda's winds tapered about 30 minutes later, which gave the crew just enough time to move the barges back to the dock and get secured, Dryden said.\n\nBut Ida wasn't through with Port Fourchon just yet.\n\n\"No sooner than we got them secured, the back side of the eye came and we were in for another ride for about three or four hours,\" Dryden said. \"The back end was way worse. I was concerned, but at least it was blowing us to the dock and not away from it. It was wild.\"\n\nThere were about 40 boats carrying around 300 people combined at Port Fourchon when Ida made landfall Sunday, said Chett Chiasson, executive director of the Greater Lafourche Port Commission.\n\nThe port, at the southern tip of Lafourche Parish, serves as the service hub for almost all of the Gulf of Mexico oilfield.\n\n\"There were no injuries for our employees and family and to my knowledge no major injuries in this area,\" Chiasson said. \"There will not be movement in the port until we can assess the navigable waterways for obstructions.\"\n\nAs for Dryden, he said he will never ride out a storm on a boat again."}

That acknowledgement at a press briefing came shortly after the U.S. Embassy in Kabul alerted people there that it \"cannot ensure safe passage\" to the airport for the capital city, where Islamist militants had overthrown the U.S.-backed Afghan government with astonishing speed.\n\nSenators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Mitt Romney (R-UT) urged the U.S. not to forget journalists and support staff in Afghanistan. In a letter addressed to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, they said there are still about 200-plus journalists and support staff as well as their families in Afghanistan seeking to evacuate. \"Please ensure that as evacuation flights continue, journalists and support staff are not forgotten,\" the senators said. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said at the briefing Wednesday afternoon that \"we have seen reports that the Taliban, contrary to their public statements and their commitments to our government, are blocking Afghans who wish to leave the country from reaching the airport.\"\n\nThe U.S. military in Kabul and a team in Qatar are \"engaging directly with the Taliban to make clear that we expect them to allow all American citizens, all third-country nationals and all Afghans who wish to leave, to do so safely and without harassment,\" Sherman said. She added that \"so far, it appears that the Taliban's commitment for safe passage for Americans has been solid,\" though she noted that she doesn't know about \"every case.\" But Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin acknowledged Wednesday that the military currently lacks the capability to safely escort Americans in Kabul to the airport for evacuation. \"I don't have the capability to go out and extend operations currently into Kabul,\" Austin said. About 2,000 people have been evacuated in the past 24 hours, Sherman said, with more than 4,840 processed for evacuation over the previous few days.\n\nThe Biden administration has come under intensifying criticism over the chaos in Afghanistan, where the Taliban have seized control just weeks before the U.S. ends its military presence there after nearly two decades of war. Even President Joe Biden's Democratic allies have called for investigations into the government's handling of the withdrawal. The insurgents' rapid advance caught the U.S. off guard, prompting scenes of panic at Hamid Karzai International Airport as thousands of Afghans rushed the tarmac, with some clinging to airplanes even as they took off. About 4,500 U.S. troops were deployed to the airport to facilitate the evacuation. Some troops have reportedly fired warning shots into the air, intending to control the crowds of arrivals. \"The events and images of the last week have been wrenching for all of us,\" Sherman said at the briefing, describing the situation as \"enormously challenging and fluid.\" \"This is an all-hands-on-deck effort, and we aren't going to let up,\" she said."}

But Trump's absence represents one final act of defiance of the norms and traditions of Washington that he has flouted for four years.\n\nHistorian Douglas Brinkley said that while attending the inauguration \"would be a wonderful olive branch to the country,\" he wasn't surprised by the decision.\n\n\"Donald Trump doesn't want to be in Washington as the second-fiddle loser standing on stage with Joe Biden,\" he said.\n\nWhile Trump stays away, former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton will be there to stand witness to the rite of democracy. The only other living president, 96-year-old Jimmy Carter, who has spent the pandemic largely at home in Georgia, will not attend but has extended \"best wishes\" to Biden.\n\nTrump's tweet that he would boycott the inauguration came as he holed up in the White House with a dwindling coterie of aides and as momentum grew on Capitol Hill to subject him to impeachment for a second time.\n\n\"To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th,\" Trump said in a tweet.\n\nIt may have been his last. The company announced Friday evening that it had permanently suspended Trump from its platform, citing the \"risk of further incitement of violence.\" The sitting president said the company was trying to \"silence\" him and replied in an official statement that he was \"negotiating\" with other social media platforms while looking at \"the possibilities of building out our own platform.\"\n\nTrump's decision not to attend the inauguration was not a surprise: For more than two months, he has falsely claimed he won reelection and advanced baseless claims of widespread voter fraud, even though his own administration has said the election was fairly run.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, urged Trump to reconsider.\n\n\"He is, of course, not constitutionally required to attend and I can imagine losing an election is very hard, but I believe he should attend,\" Scott said in a statement. The senator called the rite \"an important tradition that demonstrates the peaceful transfer of power to our people and to the world.\""}

His resignation meant he avoided a likely impeachment trial.\n\nChris Cuomo was suspended on Tuesday, after the release of documentation collected during James's investigation of Andrew Cuomo.\n\nThe information released by James showed how Chris Cuomo pressed sources for information on his brother's accusers, reported to the governor's staff and was active in helping shape responses to the charges.\n\nWhile Cuomo has said he never tried to influence CNN's own coverage of his brother, he told investigators about calls to other journalists to find out what information they had about some accusers.\n\nThat seemed to conflict with an on-air statement Cuomo gave on CNN following his brother's resignation in August, when he said: \"I never made calls to the press about my brother's situation.\"\n\nCuomo also said he never \"attacked, nor encouraged anyone to attack any woman who came forward\".

Let's get into it.\n\nFROZEN OVER\n\nUnthinkably cold temperatures have knocked Texas' energy facilities offline.\n\nElectricity prices spiked more than 10,000% when the winter storm hit this week. There are blackouts across the state. More than 4 million Texans were without power early Tuesday.\n\nPOINTING FINGERS\n\nAlthough some are attempting to pin the blame on one fuel source or another, the reality is that the Arctic temperatures are hobbling fossil fuels and renewable energy alike, my colleague Matt Egan explains.\n\nIt's striking that these power outages are happening in mighty Texas, the energy powerhouse of America. A bit of context:\n\nTexas produces more electricity than any other US state — generating almost twice as much as Florida, the next-closest, according to federal statistics.\n\nTexas is the No. 1 state in both crude oil and natural gas.\n\nWind power is also booming in Texas, which produced about 28% of all the US wind-powered electricity in 2019.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED?\n\nSo how did such a powerhouse get knocked so thoroughly offline?\n\nWe may not know the full definitive reason for a while, but a few things are clear:\n\nObviously, Texas winters ain't usually this cold. The state's infrastructure is simply not prepared for a deep freeze.\n\nCritics of renewables will try to blame wind turbines, but experts note that wind makes up a small share of Texas' energy consumption.\n\nIt's also worth poinitng out that a lot of chillier places have wind turbines that don't buckle in the cold — hello, Iowa; hej hej, Denmark — they just need to be winterized, a step experts said Texas has skipped.\n\nThe Lone Star State is ... all alone. Texas made a conscious decision to isolate its energy grid from the rest of the country. That means that when things are running smoothly, it can't export excess power to neighboring states. And in the current crisis, it can't import power either.\n\nIn other words: \"When it comes to electricity, what happens in Texas stays in Texas,\" said Dan Cohan, associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University. \"That has really come back to bite us.\"\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\nTo believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1 billion — would have been borderline irrational.\n\n— US District Court Judge Jesse Furman\n\nCiti just lost a bid to fix a major oopsie. Last year, the bank fat-fingered $900 million to lenders for cosmetics company Revlon. Some lenders returned the erroneous funds, but others refused, prompting Citi to sue to recover half a billion dollars. On Tuesday, a federal judge said — and I'm paraphrasing here — lol no.\n\nTHE FOOD BUSINESS\n\nMcDonald's\n\nBIG CHICKEN\n\nAnother day, another escalation of the Chicken Sandwich Wars. At this point, you gotta do something special to make your sandwich stand out, so McDonald's is building buzz for its three new chickie sammies with a limited edition $5 swag bundle, which includes a hoodie, a vinyl recording of a custom song and, of course, a sandwich. (The star has got to be the hoodie, which comes in a hue that I can best describe as a \"light fried chicken color.\")\n\nBIG VEGAN\n\nNow for basically the opposite of chicken sandwiches: We have vegan KitKats now. Instead of dairy, KitKat V will use a rice-based alternative. Healthier? Nah. But more inclusive of people who eat plant-based diets? Yes!\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY\n\n$50,000\n\nBitcoin hit an all-time high above $50,000 on Tuesday. That statement might have sounded like a joke a year ago, when the crypto cost $10,000. But bitcoin has skyrocketed during the pandemic thanks to rock-bottom interest rates that have severely weakened the US dollar. That makes bitcoin, a comparatively attractive currency.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS GOING ON\n\nMove over, Robinhood, here comes Goldman Sachs.

But there's no such thing as a routine impeachment.\n\nThe one President Donald Trump faces now, after inciting a riotous mob to attack the Capitol, is unprecedented in all sorts of ways, which means the process will feel entirely new and different from the one we saw in late 2019 around the Ukraine investigation.\n\nSpecifically, this House impeachment vote is likely to be done this week, and the Senate trial will occur after Trump leaves office.\n\nHere's another look at the impeachment process as it is spelled out in the Constitution and how it applies to this second impeachment of Trump, in which a US President is accused for the first time of inciting violence against another branch of government.\n\nWhat does the Constitution say about who can be impeached and for what reasons?\n\nThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. (Article 2, Section 4)\n\nWhat is Trump accused of doing?\n\nThere was a lot of debate during Trump's first impeachment and trial about whether the pressure he exerted on the President of Ukraine amounted to \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" or simply a set of policies.\n\nThis time, while there's an argument he committed treason, Democrats in the House have alleged Trump \"engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States.\"\n\nThe Article argues that Trump incited his supporters by repeatedly denying the election results in the lead-up to the counting of the electoral votes, that he pressured Georgia's secretary of state to \"find\" additional votes for him, and in doing so he \"gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,\" \"threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government.\"\n\nRead the entire thing here. It's short.\n\nWhat does the Constitution say about the House's role?\n\nThe House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment. (Article 1, Section 2)\n\nWhat does that mean for Trump this time?\n\nGetting from Trump's misdeed to impeachment proceedings in the House took 86 days in 2019.\n\nIt's going to take just a week in 2021.\n\nThe House can essentially impeach at will. While there are precedents in place around instigating the impeachment process and utilizing House committees to investigate whether impeachable offenses occurred, none of that is necessarily required. And Democrats, moving quickly, aren't going to burden themselves by dragging this out.\n\nAnd why bother with an investigation when this time Trump did it on TV? In that first effort, the details of Trump's pressure on Ukraine leaked out over the course of weeks and built into Democratic support to launch and conduct an investigation and, ultimately, to impeach him.\n\nWith Trump's time in office set to expire at noon on January 20, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also gave Trump and Vice President Mike Pence the option of avoiding impeachment if either Trump resigned or Pence mobilized the Cabinet to use the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.\n\nWhen those two offramps were ignored, Democrats in the House moved quickly toward impeachment and the first post-presidential impeachment trial in US history.\n\nImpeaching Trump in the House requires only a simple majority and Democrats hope to gain at least some support from Republicans.\n\nWhat does the Constitution say about the Senate's role?"}

The agents then euthanized and cut open the alligator \"and that's when they discovered the body parts,\" Vitter said. \"It was the upper parts of a human body.\"\n\nThe Satterlee home is not far from an area frequented by tourists who visit for swamp tours promising sightings of alligators and other wildlife, Vitter said. Alligators do not usually attack humans unless the food they have stashed has been displaced, as can occur during major storms, he said.\n\nSatterlee's wife saw a large alligator attack her husband after he had gone outside their raised home to check on the contents of their ground-level shed. The alligator had him in a \"death roll\" and had ripped off one of his arms, Vitter said, recounting the wife's statement to authorities.

Two subsidiaries of Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., the container vessels' owner, and Evergreen Group, a Taiwanese conglomerate that operated it under a long-term charter, had asked a London judge for the stay.\n\nEarlier this year, they obtained another order limiting some claims against the ship to 84 million pounds ($116 million).\n\nThe 400-meter-long Ever Given grounded in the Suez canal for several days in March, blocking the route in both directions and disrupting global trade. Last week, it began its voyage out of the canal and left Egyptian waters on Wednesday.\n\nThe owners expect to be sued by Evergreen and foresee potentially thousands more legal claims lodged by individual cargo owners against individual ship owners, their court lawyer Stewart Buckingham said at the London hearing.\n\nThe stay in proceedings will allow similar and overlapping claims to potentially be grouped together, limiting legal costs and court time, he said.\n\nA further court hearing will be held in two months, when the owners will be equipped with more information as to any claims filed against it, allowing them to \"see the lay of the land,\" Buckingham said.\n\n\"The owners' position is that they are not liable for the grounding incident or its consequences,\" he said in a court filing. When the ship became stuck, it was being led by a Suez Canal pilot, who had earlier taken over from the harbor pilot who had driven the ship from the Suez anchorage into the canal, he said.\n\nWhile there was some damage to the bow of the ship as a result of the incident, no injuries, deaths or pollution are understood to have occurred and the death of a canal worker involved in the re-floating is thought to be unrelated, he said.\n\nLawyers for the owner didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A lawyer for Evergreen declined to comment.\n\nAny claims filed in the U.K. will likely take years before reaching a resolution. Some may be resolved by arbitration, an alternative and generally private alternative to long and costly court battles."}

Picking up intensity overnight as it moved over warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, it hit the Louisiana coast as a Category 4 hurricane.\n\nWhat started as a disturbance in the Atlantic Ocean quickly grew to what could be the worst hurricane to hit Louisiana since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. While scientists are uncertain whether climate change will increase the frequency of hurricanes, one thing is clear: Climate change is here, and it's making these storms stronger and more destructive.\n\n\"Until recently, it was common to think of climate change as a problem for future generations, saying people in the future will have to deal with it,\" said Andrew Dessler, a professor in the College of Geosciences at Texas A&M University. \"But now it's quite clear that we are the people of the future. The future has arrived, and we are having to deal with it now.\"\n\nBe it Hurricane Ida or the wildfires that continue to burn across California, climate change is making disasters more destructive, more expensive and more impactful on humans, he said.\n\nAccording to the United Nation's latest climate report published earlier this month, it is \"unequivocal\" that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land, and it's already affecting weather and climate extremes around the world. Dessler calls the report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change a confirmation of what scientists have suspected for decades.\n\nHe explains that the effects of climate change on storm severity manifests in several ways. Most obviously, rising sea levels have led to higher storm surges. Hotter temperatures create more water vapor in the atmosphere, which in turn means more rainfall. Perhaps less intuitively, he said, warmer water also means stronger winds. It all makes for a more destructive hurricane, as was the case with Ida.\n\nTake Hurricanes Laura, Michael and Harvey, for example, which hit the U.S. in just the last few years. Before Harvey, he said, a storm producing 60 inches of rain over the course of a three or four days would have been \"unimaginable.\"\n\n\"Whether we get storms that more rapidly intensify is something that people have been talking about in the last few years,\" he said. \"A lot of scientists believe that's something else we'll get. We'll get these storms that look anemic offshore and then spin up into monsters in 24 or 48 hours.\"\n\nWith little advance notice, this would make it increasingly difficult for decision makers at the local and state levels to evacuate residents and deploy first responders. It takes a city about 72 hours to prepare for a disaster to hit, Dessler said.\n\n\"If this starts to happen more and more frequently, if you start having these storms that intensify extremely rapidly, it's going to make it very hard for people to respond to the storms in ways they could respond if they had a week's warning,\" he said.\n\nIn Louisiana, hundreds of thousands of people are still without power, and Gov. John Bel Edwards has told evacuees not to return until infrastructure is restored. Dessler said one growing concern is that another disaster could come in the form of a heat wave."}

The question isn't the most important one following the accidental tragedy. Yet, it does inform the calculus on what's to come.\n\nMost observers may not care about the millions of dollars put into this indie film. Very few are considering what it would be like for anyone in the cast and crew to get back on set and finish a Western that was reportedly about halfway through production before the Oct. 21 accident. Instead, most news stories that do point toward the future are speculating about the possibility of criminal charges and the potential for civil lawsuits. Producers for the film have hired Brandon Fox at Jenner & Block to handle an investigation.\n\n\"If the facts and evidence and law support charges, then I will initiate prosecution at that time,\" Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said at a press conference on Wednesday. \"I do not make rash decisions and cannot rush to judgment.\"\n\nBut the choice to finish or abandon the film could very well play a role on how this all shakes out. All productions begin with several rounds of risk assessment. Investors must look at the prospect of recouping, while even the most optimistic producers take out insurance in case anything goes wrong.\n\nRust was no exception, and the film insurance policy will likely cover at least part of the tab for the shutdown and probably even the costs for defending and settling negligence claims. (Some insurers exclude gross negligence. That's a whole other discussion.) But there's certainly a limit, and that's why many banks that lend money for film and television production insist upon a completion bond.\n\nAlso called a completion guarantee, completion bonds act almost like umbrella insurance policies to fill in any gaps and get the production to the finish line.\n\nMultiple sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that Rust had trouble obtaining a completion bond, which isn't unusual as premiums can be expensive — and which has become even less unusual amid the pandemic and its attendant production shutdowns.\n\nA rep for Rust did not refute THR's sources and pointed to a statement that read: \"We have halted production on the film for an undetermined period of time and are fully cooperating with all investigations and inquiries.\"\n\nBut if the film had trouble obtaining a completion bond, the absence of a financial savior also means that those with a stake in the Rust enterprise — those who put up money (the budget was reportedly $7 million to $8 million), those owed money — may eye whatever is left in the bank account plus any meager insurance proceeds and attempt to position themselves for an exit.

Ron DeSantis held a hastily-called news conference to announce a proposal to penalize social media companies for blocking politicians, even if they incite violence.\n\n\"We've seen the power of their censorship over individuals and organizations, including what I believe is clear viewpoint discrimination,'' said DeSantis as Florida's Senate president and House speaker stood at his side. \"Under our proposal, if a technology company de-platforms a candidate for elected office in Florida during the election, a company will face a daily fine of $100,000 until the candidate's access to the platform is restored again.\"\n\nThe proposed bill, which is still being drafted, asks the Florida Legislature to impose penalties for social media companies whose algorithms are perceived to favor one candidate over another. It builds on SB 520, filed by state Sen. Danny Burgess, that would require the platforms to give a 30-day notice to a user whose account has been disabled or suspended and explain why the user was punished.\n\nAlthough the governor never mentioned the former president, who was banned by Facebook and Twitter after they said he used his accounts to incite violence and disseminate conspiracy theories about the election, the timing of the announcement coincided with the filing by Trump's lawyers in the pending impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn a 14-page brief, lawyers David Schoen and Bruce Castor wrote that when Trump told his supporters \"if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore\" it was not meant as a reference to violent action but was intended to be \"about the need to fight for election security in general.\"\n\nThey also denied that Trump had incited the riot by disputing the election results or by exhorting his followers to action. By contrast, the U.S. House accuses Trump of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" for inciting the violent insurrection.\n\n\"The actions by the House make clear that in their opinion the 45th president does not enjoy the protections of liberty upon which this great nation was founded, where free speech, and indeed, free political speech form the backbone of all American liberties,\" the defense lawyers wrote.\n\nDeSantis, whose allegiance to Trump began when the former president used his Twitter account to endorse DeSantis over his Republican primary rivals in the 2018 Florida election for governor, blasted \"the big tech oligarchy\" for being \"more of a clear and present danger to the rights of free speech, than the government itself.\"\n\nHe accused the social media companies of having a bias against conservatives because they didn't ban from their accounts the supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement and Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, both of whom DeSantis said used their accounts to incite violence.\n\n\"They have so much garbage and filth on that platform, all the time,'' he said. \"They did not censor people when they were using those platforms for the rioting that occurred over the summer, so their excuse doesn't hold water.\""}

The vaccine is produced by the Beijing-based pharmaceutical company Sinovac.\n\n\"The world desperately needs multiple COVID-19 vaccines to address the huge access inequity across the globe,\" said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Health Products. \"We urge manufacturers to participate in the COVAX Facility, share their knowhow and data and contribute to bringing the pandemic under control.\"\n\nWHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for COVAX Facility vaccine supply and international procurement. It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe EUL assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as risk management plans and programmatic suitability, such as cold chain requirements. The assessment is performed by the product evaluation group, composed by regulatory experts from around the world and a Technical Advisory Group (TAG), in charge of performing the risk-benefit assessment for an independent recommendation on whether a vaccine can be listed for emergency use and, if so, under which conditions.\n\nIn the case of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine, the WHO assessment included on-site inspections of the production facility.\n\nThe Sinovac-CoronaVac product is an inactivated vaccine. Its easy storage requirements make it very manageable and particularly suitable for low-resource settings.\n\nWHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has also completed its review of the vaccine. On the basis of available evidence, WHO recommends the vaccine for use in adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of two to four weeks. Vaccine efficacy results showed that the vaccine prevented symptomatic disease in 51% of those vaccinated and prevented severe COVID-19 and hospitalization in 100% of the studied population.\n\nFew older adults (over 60 years) were enrolled in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated in this age group. Nevertheless, WHO is not recommending an upper age limit for the vaccine because data collected during subsequent use in multiple countries and supportive immunogenicity data suggest the vaccine is likely to have a protective effect in older persons. There is no reason to believe that the vaccine has a different safety profile in older and younger populations. WHO recommends that countries using the vaccine in older age groups conduct safety and effectiveness monitoring to verify the expected impact and contribute to making the recommendation more robust for all countries.\n\nWHO emergency use listing\n\nThe emergency use listing (EUL) procedure assesses the suitability of novel health products during public health emergencies. The objective is to make medicines, vaccines and diagnostics available as rapidly as possible to address the emergency, while adhering to stringent criteria of safety, efficacy and quality. The assessment weighs the threat posed by the emergency as well as the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product against any potential risks."}

Krebs spoke with CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett for this week's episode of \"The Takeout\" podcast.\n\nPresident Biden signed an executive order Wednesday aimed at hardening the federal government's cybersecurity defenses by directing the Commerce Department to author new standards for software vendors supplying the federal government. Krebs called the action a \"dramatic game change\" that showed Mr. Biden's \"committed leadership vision\" to prioritize cybersecurity concerns.\n\nHighlights from this week's episode:\n\nChristopher Krebs on Biden's executive order: \"It dramatically increases security expectations of the software products that are sold to the federal government.\"\n\n\"It dramatically increases security expectations of the software products that are sold to the federal government.\" Presidential and congressional action on cybersecurity: \"You need both.\"\n\n\"You need both.\" Ransomware attacks: \"Ransomware is a really, really profitable business these days.\"\n\n\"Ransomware is a really, really profitable business these days.\" Need for companies to take action to secure their software: \"Everybody can do better. The threats are so diverse right now.\"\n\n\"It dramatically increases security expectations of the software products that are sold to the federal government,\" Krebs said, explaining that this would have a \"cascading effect\" for products sold to ordinary American customers.\n\nKrebs praised Mr. Biden for \"jettisoning the traditional approach\" to addressing cybersecurity, but said that Congress needed to act to shore up the nation's cyber infrastructure as well. Krebs has previously called on Mr. Biden to incorporate this into his $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal.\n\n\"You need both,\" Krebs said, meaning presidential and congressional action.\n\nKrebs also responded to the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, after the company announced Wednesday that it has begun restarting pipeline operations after a cyberattack forced the company to take some of its systems offline last Friday.\n\n\"Ransomware is a really, really profitable business these days,\" Krebs remarked.\n\nThe company, which operates a major energy pipeline, first announced the hack a week ago, also soon disclosed that \"this incident involves ransomware.\" Several sources told CBS News on Thursday that Colonial Pipeline did pay a ransom to the hackers who had infiltrated its computer network. The money was paid shortly after the computer systems started locking up late last week.\n\nThe FBI said Monday that the attack was the work of a criminal gang known as DarkSide, an operation which Krebs said was composed mainly of Russian individuals, many in their teens or early twenties. Colonial Pipeline said an outside security firm is investigating the incident.\n\nKrebs said that DarkSide not only holds data for ransom, but exfiltrates it as well, calling the operation \"fifth-dimension chess here from a criminal perspective.\""}

It attributed Floyd's death to \"medical distress\" and made no mention that the Black man had been pinned to the ground at the neck by Chauvin, or that he'd cried out that he couldn't breathe.\n\nMany were posting the release to highlight the distance between the initial police narrative and the evidence that led to the conviction Tuesday, including excruciating video shot by a teenage bystander of Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck, even after Floyd had stopped moving.\n\nAnd while Chauvin's conviction is a high-profile case of video rebutting initial police statements, criminal justice experts and police accountability advocates say the problem of inaccurate initial reports — especially in fatal police encounters — is widespread.\n\n\"If it wasn't for this 17-year-old who took the video, Derek Chauvin would in all likelihood still be on the police force training officers,\" said Andre Johnson, a University of Memphis professor of communication studies. \"Sadly, this has been going on for a while, and it's just now coming to light for a lot of Americans because of video evidence.\"\n\nFor their part, police officials say they give the most accurate information they can during fast-moving and complicated investigations. But the frequency with which misleading information is published cannot be ignored, critics say.\n\nIn 2014, the New York Police Department's narrative of Eric Garner's death was that he'd gone into cardiac arrest. It made no mention of an officer's extended chokehold on Garner, shown in a bystander video that captured repeated pleas that he couldn't breathe. A grand jury declined to indict the since-fired officer Daniel Pantaleo, who said he was using a legal maneuver called a seat belt.\n\nA year later, then-policeman Michael Slager said he shot Walter Scott because he'd grabbed for the officer's stun gun. But bystander video of the North Charleston, South Carolina, shooting showed Slager chase Scott after he fled a traffic stop and fatally shoot him in the back. Slager was charged with murder in state court, but released after a hung jury. He later pleaded guilty to federal civil rights violations.\n\nAs the chorus of complaints about misinformation on such interactions grows, so do calls for body cameras for police. Roughly 80% of departments with 500 officers or more are now using cameras, but video storage can be costly.\n\nOfficial police video is also increasingly showing discrepancies in initial police narratives, though generally the images are withheld for days or sometimes months during internal investigations.\n\nChicago police were ordered by a court to release dashcam video of the 2014 killing of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald more than 13 months after the shooting. It was initially ruled a justified shooting based on an officer narrative that McDonald had approached police while refusing to drop a knife. The video showed then-officer Jason Van Dyke shooting the teen 16 times as he walked away. Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder.\n\nJohnson said it shouldn't take video evidence of Black Americans being mistreated or killed for people to support policing changes. He noted that when there is video evidence, it's often scrutinized and still rejected by some as fake or deceptive."}

There have already been a couple dozen arrests, and many more are certain to come. There is an active federal investigation of the murder of a police officer at the hands of the pro-Trump mob, and media and political figures have raised the prospect of Trump's criminal exposure for the bloodshed. There will certainly be convictions and prison sentences.\n\nBut it is quite likely that this fate will only apply to those unfamous citizens who joined the mob, not their ideological masters.\n\nWhen it comes to holding the most powerful responsible for their role in crimes, particularly those committed while holding high office, the U.S. track record is anemic. While Democrats are rightly intent on proceeding with impeachment and other measures against Trump, the reality is that U.S. history is rife with episodes of political elites ultimately deciding to move on \"for the good of the country.\" It is why so many shameless Republicans are whining about the need to unify the country so it can heal. They know the game.\n\nListening to many Democrats and some Republicans speak in holy terms about the \"sanctity\" of the \"temple of democracy\" being pillaged and ransacked, it is easy to be seduced into believing that this time will be different, that the perpetrators — from top to bottom — will be held to account. But doing so would buck a long-standing pillar of the bipartisan system: When it comes to the crimes of the powerful, we must always look forward.\n\nNo senior military official was prosecuted for the torture at the Abu Ghraib detention center in Iraq. No CIA officer went to jail, much less lost their job, for operating a global kidnapping and torture program. No one faced an indictment for the U.S. use of banned cluster bomb munitions in President Barack Obama's first airstrike in Yemen in December 2009 that shredded a few dozen human beings into ground meat. The failure to hold senior U.S. officials responsible for their crimes ensures that the crimes can and will continue. Look no further than the ascent of Gina Haspel, a key player in the CIA's torture program and the destruction of videotapes of the abuse of detainees, to become the first woman to head the agency. It was a fruit of Obama's look-forward-not-backward doctrine. There has rightly been outrage at Trump's pardons for soldiers and mercenaries convicted of war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the other side of that coin is the bipartisan refusal to prosecute the masterminds of U.S. imperial crimes in those countries or elsewhere.\n\nThe events of January 6 were shocking in only one way: the fact that a violent mob was able to so easily storm and occupy the Capitol. These events were unprecedented in that the most powerful political figure in the United States was the circus master who used incendiary language as he called on the mob to descend on the building. \"You'll never take back our country with weakness,\" Trump declared at a rally moments before the siege began. \"You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.\" Trump's disgraced lawyer Rudy Giuliani went a step further, suggesting that the mob needed to create the conditions on Capitol Hill for a \"trial by combat.\"\n\nAmong the most serious questions as yet unresolved are: What role did law enforcement and Republican members of Congress play in facilitating the violent takeover of the Capitol? What did Trump administration officials in control of federal forces and the military know leading up to the siege? And did they facilitate it either directly or through deliberate inaction?\n\nNo one should pretend that this moment was not in some form predictable."}

Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that he will resign, relinquishing under extraordinary pressure his decade-long grip on power and heading off a potential impeachment by New York's Democratic-led legislature a week after the release of a report by the state attorney general that found he had sexually harassed 11 women.\n\n\"Given the circumstances, the best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to governing,\" Cuomo said in remarks from New York City. \"Therefore that's what I'll do.\"\n\nThe son of another three-term governor, the New York Democrat indicated his announcement would take effect in two weeks. He will hand over the reins to his deputy of seven years, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Buffalo native who is now poised to become the state's first female governor. Democratic state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins would take on the active duties of the lieutenant governor should there be a vacancy in the position. Hochul will appoint her own replacement.\n\nIn the seven days since New York state Attorney General Letitia James made her report public, Cuomo faced new and more adamant calls to step down from both state and national Democrats. He initially pushed back, seeking more time, against the advice of trusted aides but ultimately relented and decided to resign before state lawmakers could begin a process that would likely have made him the first New York governor to be impeached in more than a century.\n\nThe announcement capped a remarkable fall for the governor, who was lauded for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 only to see his administration swallowed up in scandal – over his alleged sexual misbehavior, the underreporting of nursing home deaths related to the coronavirus and his potential abuse of public resources as he wrote a book last year about the pandemic in New York.\n\nAs his handling of the pandemic came under increasing scrutiny, including through an ongoing federal inquiry, a series of reports about his personal behavior left him politically stricken. Even now, as he prepares to leave office, Cuomo could potentially face criminal charges related to the allegations against him. He is also being sued by one his accusers, former aide Lindsey Boylan.\n\nCuomo has denied all of the allegations, saying he never touched anyone inappropriately, but acknowledged that some of his behavior made others uncomfortable.\n\nHe continued to skirt the line between apology and excuses during his remarks on Tuesday, thanking the women who came forward with \"sincere\" complaints, but – as he did earlier this year – he insisted that he was, politically, the victim of evolving social norms.\n\n\"In my mind, I've never crossed the line with anyone. But I didn't realize the extent to which the line has been redrawn,\" Cuomo said. \"There are generational and cultural shifts that I just didn't fully appreciate. And I should have – no excuses.\"\n\nComing to Cuomo's defense\n\nBefore Cuomo spoke, his personal lawyer, Rita Glavin, attempted to undermine the report that doomed him during a 42-minute monologue in which she claimed that the governor had been railroaded by a \"mob mentality\" among his critics.\n\nGlavin accused James and investigators of bias and sought to chip away at each of the accusers' allegations. In some cases, she issued full denials on Cuomo's behalf. In another, Glavin sought to undermine the credibility of an accuser. She also claimed, as Cuomo did earlier this year, that a number of the women cited in the report misinterpreted his actions, which she said were innocent.\n\n\"They started with a presumption that he had done some terrible things,\" Glavin said of the attorney general's team, \"and it went from there.\"\n\nShe also addressed the allegations from a state trooper who was reportedly brought on to Cuomo's protective detail at his personal request. Glavin insisted that Cuomo had sought to add her to the group in an effort to diversify the force and denied that the governor harassed her, but then apologized on his behalf – as it was described on a PowerPoint slide – \"for anything he did that caused Trooper 1 discomfort.\"\n\n\"I think that women should be believed and they should be believed and treated fairly,\" Glavin said after cycling through accusations against Cuomo. \"I also believe that men should be believed and treated fairly.\"\n\nReacting to the governor's departure\n\nJames did not respond to Glavin's assertions or Cuomo's charge that political motivations guided many of those who sought his departure, but said the governor's resignation closed \"a sad chapter for all of New York\" with \"an important step towards justice.\"\n\n\"I thank Governor Cuomo for his contributions to our state,\" James said in a statement. \"The ascension of our Lieutenant Governor, Kathy Hochul, will help New York enter a new day. We must continue to build on the progress already made and improve the lives of New Yorkers in every corner of the state.\"\n\nStewart-Cousins, the state Senate majority leader, told CNN on Tuesday that she was unsure whether the state Assembly would follow through with its impeachment process after Cuomo's resignation.\n\n\"It's up to the Assembly whether or not they want to continue down the path,\" she said.\n\nStewart-Cousins dismissed Cuomo's criticism of the report as politically motivated and pointed to the \"evidence\" turned up by the investigators.\n\n\"We all had confidence in the AG's ability to take these women's allegations seriously,\" she said. \"We've been very clear about zero tolerance of sexual harassment in the workplace.\"\n\nIn a mark of how drastically the political winds have shifted in the aftermath of the report, New York State Democratic Chairman Jay Jacobs, for years one of Cuomo's closest allies, had been among those calling for him to resign. The governor had rebuffed him at first, last week, but when the announcement came on Tuesday, Jacobs in a statement did not mention the name of his longtime friend – instead focusing on the historic nature of Hochul's ascent.\n\n\"New York will finally have its first female Governor and we could not be in better hands,\" Jacobs said. Her experience at all levels of government – Town Board Member, County Clerk, Congresswoman, and Lieutenant Governor, makes her uniquely well-equipped to effectively govern the State at this time.\""}

At that time, following the devastation of two world wars, political leaders came together to forge the multilateral system. The aims were clear: to bring countries together, to dispel the temptations of isolationism and nationalism, and to address the challenges that could only be achieved together in the spirit of solidarity and cooperation, namely peace, prosperity, health and security.\n\nToday, we hold the same hope that as we fight to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic together, we can build a more robust international health architecture that will protect future generations. There will be other pandemics and other major health emergencies. No single government or multilateral agency can address this threat alone. The question is not if, but when. Together, we must be better prepared to predict, prevent, detect, assess and effectively respond to pandemics in a highly coordinated fashion. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a stark and painful reminder that nobody is safe until everyone is safe.\n\nWe are, therefore, committed to ensuring universal and equitable access to safe, efficacious and affordable vaccines, medicines and diagnostics for this and future pandemics. Immunization is a global public good and we will need to be able to develop, manufacture and deploy vaccines as quickly as possible.\n\nThis is why the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) was set up in order to promote equal access to tests, treatments and vaccines and support health systems across the globe.

And the pipeline company has previously told federal officials it wants to first complete a headquarters move to a new building — probably in November — though the spokesman, Kevin Feeney, said on Friday that it may allow a review sooner.\n\nIt's unknown whether the government-run cybersecurity assessment would have helped Colonial avert the ransomware attack that locked up some of its computer systems this month — and led the company to shut down its entire pipeline, leaving large swaths of the East Coast with fuel shortages.\n\nBut a range of current and former officials and cybersecurity experts say the company's ability to avoid a government review underscores how a voluntary, arms-length approach by federal officials over nearly two decades has left key elements of the nation's critical infrastructure at risk.\n\n\"I'm very concerned whenever I see a lack of urgency given the potential threats we face,\" said Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.), co-founder of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus. \"You're leaving so many areas exposed by not having a review — and addressing at least the vulnerabilities that you can identify.\"\n\nNow, in the attack's wake, the Department of Homeland Security, which houses the TSA, is reversing course, scrapping two decades of a voluntary regime for pipeline cybersecurity and moving for the first time to mandatory rules.\n\nBut a review of the TSA's history since it was handed oversight of pipeline security in 2001 shows a government culture of closely partnering with energy giants and industry trade groups in setting guidelines that were voluntary. No penalty resulted for a failure to obey them.\n\nUntil the validated architecture design review debuted in December 2018, the TSA had never done a detailed cybersecurity assessment of pipelines. The VADR, as it's called, was what the TSA asked Colonial to do last year. Twenty-three have occurred this year alone — despite the pandemic.\n\n\"The cybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving and we must adapt to address new and emerging threats,\" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. \"The recent ransomware attack on a major petroleum pipeline demonstrates that the cybersecurity of pipeline systems is critical to our homeland security.\"\n\nColonial spokesman Feeney said that over the past four years, the company has hired \"four leading independent firms\" to conduct \"comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessments to bolster the company's overarching security and information governance program.\"\n\nAs a result, he said, the company has boosted total information technology spending by about 50 percent since 2017.\n\nThe DHS shift in regulatory approach comes as ransomware attacks, in which hackers demand a fee to unlock computers whose data has been encrypted, are spreading from hospitals, universities and municipalities to industrial sectors out of a sense that these critical infrastructure companies will be more willing to pay to regain control of their systems. And it follows the intelligence community's public warning in 2019 that nation states had the ability to launch cyberattacks that could disrupt \"a natural gas pipeline\" for days to weeks.\n\n\"The lesson, particularly in recent months, is that we need to step up the incentives for the critical infrastructure to strengthen cybersecurity,\" said Michael Chertoff, who served as secretary of homeland security in the George W. Bush administration. \"Positive incentives are important, but sometimes you need to be mandatory.\"\n\nVoluntary vs. mandatory\n\nThe TSA was created in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to safeguard aviation, but pipelines — seen as a mode of transportation — were moved under its jurisdiction, too. And for the first half of its existence, physical security was the focus.\n\nPersonnel at the TSA's pipeline security program ensured that fences around pipeline facilities were high enough to keep out intruders. The threat of cyber-hacking was not a front-burner issue.\n\nBut by 2010, things had changed.\n\nIncreasingly, energy, oil and gas and pipeline systems were operated by automated systems that checked temperatures, pressures and flows.\n\nAnd concerns about cyberattacks grew — including at pipelines."}

There were only two mass shootings in 2020 amid a record number of gun violence deaths, as per the database.\n\nGun control advocates nationwide have called for stricter background checks, among other initiatives, to reduce rates of gun violence. A 2018 study found that states with stricter background checks for weapon and ammunition purchases had fewer school shootings.\n\nHowever, support for stricter gun control has fallen, according to a recent Gallup poll. Only 52% of respondents said they wanted stricter gun laws, the lowest recording since 2014.\n\nIt is not clear yet where the handgun — a 9mm Sig Sauer SP 2022 pistol — used by the 15-year-old shooting suspect had been purchased. The firearm was bought by the suspect's father just four days before the shooting, police said. Prosecutors said on Wednesday that they may charge the suspect's parents."}

(AP) — A crank caller ordered an \"insurrection pizza\" from Pauline Bauer's restaurant. A profane piece of hate mail addressed her as a domestic terrorist. She even became a punchline for Stephen Colbert's late-night talk show on CBS.\n\nA swift backlash greeted Capitol riot suspects like Bauer when they returned to their homes across the U.S. after joining the mob that stormed past police barricades, smashed windows and disrupted the certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory on Jan. 6. Relatives, friends or co-workers reported scores of them to the FBI. Some lost jobs. Others lost their freedom, jailed awaiting trials.\n\nIn Bauer's hometown in rural Pennsylvania, her arrest and that of a longtime friend have rekindled partisan bickering, more often on social media than on street corners, some residents say. As Bauer and William Blauser Jr. fight the charges in court, many in the town of Kane have struggled to comprehend how two of their neighbors could be among the hundreds of Trump loyalists bent on overturning the election that day.\n\n\"I think it was totally outrageous, it was illegal and I think it was treasonous,\" said Joe Lanich, who operates a letterpress print shop with his wife called The Laughing Owl Press Co. in Kane's uptown business district. He said the town is populated by proud residents who work hard to improve Kane and \"don't want to see one person paint us in a bad light.\"\n\nBauer tries to shrug off the scorn from strangers, but acknowledges her actions have angered some in her community.\n\n\"Some people didn't like the fact that I became political,\" she said during a break in dinner service at her restaurant, Bob's Trading Post.\n\nIn the months since Jan. 6, former President Donald Trump and his supporters have sought to portray the rioters as peaceful patriots even as videos from that day show members of the mob beating police officers and hunting for lawmakers in an unthinkable attack on the seat of American democracy. On Tuesday, officers who defended the Capitol that day described to a congressional committee investigating the insurrection how they feared for their lives and continue to suffer physical and emotional pain.\n\nBauer was heard shouting at police to \"bring Nancy Pelosi out\" to be hanged during the riot, the FBI says. Five people died in the attack or its aftermath, and dozens of law enforcement officers were injured. More than 500 people have been charged with federal crimes.\n\nEven so, some in Kane have stood by Bauer, who insists her actions haven't cost her any friendships or harmed her business. On a recent Wednesday evening, tables at her restaurant were filled by her regular customers.\n\n\"She's a human being who stood up for her rights. She should have a right to stand up for what she believes in,\" said Glenn Robinson, 68.\n\nSuch political division over how Jan. 6 unfolded has occurred in communities across the country. Forty-seven percent of Republicans say it can be described as a \"legitimate protest,\" while only 13% of Democrats say the same, according to a June poll from Monmouth University.\n\nA new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that 81% of Democrats say it's \"extremely\" or \"very\" important that investigations continue into what happened during the Capitol breach, but just 38% of Republicans say the same.\n\nBauer was arrested in May along with Blauser, a Vietnam War veteran and retired mail carrier. Surveillance video shows the two of them entering the Capitol through an east Rotunda door where at least three police officers were trying to block entry. Video from a police officer's body camera captured Bauer saying to bring out Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House.\n\n\"Bring them out now. They're criminals. They need to hang,\" she said.\n\nTrump received nearly three-quarters of the votes in the 2020 election in the county that incudes Kane, a borough in northwest Pennsylvania with roughly 3,500 residents, over 97% of whom are white. Many homes and businesses in town are still decorated with Trump signs and flags. A warehouse adorned with pro-Trump posters also has one that reads \"Burn Loot Murder,\" a derisive reference to the Black Lives Matter movement."}

She usually has to criss-cross the picturesque region by bus to find discounts at Dollar Tree, Grocery Outlet and Walmart.\n\nSo when she learned about Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan to send $600 payments to the lowest income Californians in February, Clendenin felt relief.\n\nThen came frustration.\n\nClendenin scoured the news for details on eligibility. She learned that she could have qualified if she worked in 2020. But a constellation of diabetes, arthritis, migraines, back injuries and nerve pain made work impossible about six years ago. Given her disabilities, she could also have qualified if only she received Supplemental Security Income, a federal safety-net program for elderly, blind and disabled people with limited income.\n\nBut nowhere could Clendenin find mention of Social Security Disability Insurance, the other main federal program for people with disabilities, which sends her $1,056 a month.\n\n\"I couldn't believe that we were left out,\" said Clendenin. \"How unfair is that?\"\n\nIt's a sentiment shared by many Californians on federal disability insurance, who have asked why Newsom's stimulus payments skipped them over.\n\nWhile California lawmakers automatically sent checks to 1.2 million people who receive SSI, the 1.2 million Californians on SSDI only qualify if they had income from work in 2020. But that's rare — research shows that fewer than one in five SSDI recipients work during a typical year, often because they are limited by their disabilities or risk losing their benefits if they work too much.\n\nDisability advocates say it's the latest example of the state abandoning some of its most vulnerable residents during the pandemic, after having directed medical health providers to ration COVID-19 care to elderly and less healthy people last spring and deprioritize people with disabilities for vaccines earlier this year — both policies that were reversed after considerable outcry.\n\n\"Overall the state has been uneven in how it's helped people with disabilities navigate the pandemic,\" said Andrew Imparato, executive director of Disability Rights California. \"A lot of people with disabilities have had to fend for themselves.\"\n\nDepartment of Finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer cites logistical challenges. California maintains an up-to-date list of residents who get SSI because the state supplements the federal benefit by a few hundred dollars, but doesn't have access to the same information for SSDI.\n\n\"Trying to include SSDI... would be a time-consuming and laborious process with the feds that doesn't line up with the intent of (the Golden State Stimulus) — to get immediate relief to Californians with whom we have an existing relationship,\" Palmer wrote in an email.\n\n'Make hard decisions quickly'\n\nThe Newsom administration may have also based the decision on a consideration of need.\n\nCalifornia's SSI recipients live in poverty by definition. Elderly, blind and disabled people can only qualify if they have extremely low income and wealth, and they typically receive just $954.72 per month."}

Woods was removed from the crash by firefighters, and his vehicle suffered \"major damage\".\n\nWoods was transported to the nearby Harbor-UCLA medical center by ambulance and underwent surgery for \"multiple leg injuries\" after the incident early on Tuesday.\n\nWoods had been driving a 2021 Genesis GV80 northbound on Hawthorne Boulevard when he drove over the center median, into the southbound lanes, struck a tree and rolled the vehicle several times, said Alex Villanueva, the Los Angeles county sheriff, at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nPhotos of the crash site showed Woods's badly damaged SUV at the bottom of an embankment in hilly terrain.\n\nThe crash is still under investigation. Gonzalez noted that this \"specific stretch of roadway is one of our trouble spots\". Deputies have often caught motorists speeding here, sometimes at up to 80mph, which would be nearly double the locally reported speed limit. Gonzalez said Woods was responsive and coherent when he arrived on scene, and was able to tell him his name.\n\nThough his injuries were visible, Woods appeared to be in shock and unconcerned with them, Gonzalez said. \"I've been doing this for a while. I've seen fatal traffic collisions,\" the deputy added. \"It was very fortunate that Mr Woods was able to come out of this alive.\"\n\nWoods was the only person in the vehicle at the time of the accident and was conscious when deputies arrived on scene. While the cause of the crash has not yet been determined, Villanueva said Woods' vehicle was \"going at a relatively greater speed than normal\". When asked if Woods was under the influence at the time of the crash, Villanueva said there was \"no evidence of impairment at this point in time\".\n\nAuthorities previously reported that Woods had to be extricated from the vehicle by the jaws of life, but fire department personnel were able to remove him with the help of an axe and Halligan tool, said Daryl Osby, the Los Angeles county fire chief.\n\nResponding to the news, former US president Barack Obama tweeted: \"Sending my prayers to @TigerWoods and his family tonight – here's to a speedy recovery for the GOAT of golf.

I'm sure they're struggling.\"\n\nJack Nicklaus, the 18-times major champion and lone name above Woods on the all-time leaderboard, said he was \"deeply concerned\" by the news in a statement. \"Barbara and I just heard about Tiger's accident, and like everyone else, we are deeply concerned,\" Nicklaus said. \"We want to offer him our heartfelt support and prayers at this difficult time.\"\n\nThe PGA Tour released a statement shortly after news of the crash broke, saying: \"On behalf of the PGA Tour and our players, Tiger is in our prayers and will have our full support as he recovers.\"\n\nWoods had been in California to film a TV programme for Discovery and Golf Digest, featuring the former NBA player Dwyane Wade and the actor David Spade. He also attended the PGA Tour's Genesis Invitational at Riviera over the weekend. He has not played competitive golf this year after undergoing back surgery last month.\n\nIn May 2017, Woods was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in Florida after he was discovered passed out in his car. He later pleaded guilty to reckless driving over the incident, and said his condition was caused by prescribed medications.\n\nWoods was also involved in another crash in 2009 near his home in Florida, which led to news that he had been unfaithful to his then wife, Elin Nordegren. The fallout led to Woods losing sponsors and he took an extended break from golf to address problems in his private life."}

Of course, Brady did what Brady does and helped the Tampa Bay Buccaneers win the Vince Lombardi for the second time in franchise history.\n\nThe win on the game's biggest stage was Brady's seventh, allowing him to add to his already legendary collection of Super Bowl records. In fact, let's take a closer look at them.\n\nMost Super Bowl wins: 7\n\nBrady is just lapping the field when it comes to Super Bowl wins. Seven rings — the first six of which earned as a member of the New England Patriots — is two more than the next closest player. Defensive lineman Charles Haley won five rings with the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys. Among quarterbacks, Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw are next with four wins on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nMost Super Bowl appearances: 10\n\nSunday's Super Bowl was the 10th time Brady had led his team to the title game. He has now done so on more than half of his non-injured seasons as a starting quarterback, and thus appeared in 18 percent of all Super Bowls played so far. The player coming closest to him is former Buffalo Bills and Denver Broncos defensive lineman Mike Lodish, who appeared in six Super Bowls. Among quarterbacks, John Elway's five appearances come closest.\n\nMost Super Bowl MVP awards: 5\n\nJoe Montana was named the Super Bowl's Most Valuable Player in three of his title game appearances, but Brady has long passed his former idol on that list. He now has earned the MVP five times: he earned it after Super Bowls 36, 38, 49 and 51 in New England, and now after the 55th edition of the big game in Tampa Bay. The only teammates of his who were able to earn the trophy were wide receivers Deion Branch (Super Bowl 39) and Julian Edelman (Super Bowl 53).\n\nMost Super Bowl pass attempts: 421\n\nBrady dropped back to pass 30 times on Sunday, with 29 passes leaving his right arm. He therefore became the first quarterback to cross the 400-attempt mark in the Super Bowl to bring his total to 421. Next on that list is Peyton Manning, who threw 155 passes during his four games with the Broncos and Indianapolis Colts.\n\nMost Super Bowl completions: 277\n\nDue to his 21 completions against Kansas City, Brady now has thrown more successful passes in the Super Bowl than the next three quarterbacks on the list combined: Peyton Manning (103), Kurt Warner (83) and Joe Montana (83) have thrown 269 completions during their careers. The three Hall of Famers have played in 11 games together, showing that Brady's completions are not just a pure volume statistic.\n\nMost Super Bowl touchdown passes: 21\n\nBrady threw three touchdowns against the Chiefs defense, hooking up twice with Rob Gronkowski and once with Antonio Brown. He therefore now has 10 more scoring throws in the Super Bowl than the next closest competitor: Joe Montana threw 11 touchdown passes in his four title game appearances with the San Francisco 49ers. Fun fact, Brady is only tied for fourth when it comes to interceptions thrown (6).\n\nMost Super Bowl passing yards: 3,039\n\nBrady added 201 passing yards against the Chiefs on Sunday to cross the 3,000-yard barrier and further set himself apart from the next closest player in this category. Kurt Warner, who played in three Super Bowls with the then-St. Louis Rams and Arizona Cardinals, passed for a combined 1,156 yards.\n\nMost pass attempts in a single Super Bowl: 62\n\nThe Patriots took the Atlanta Falcons to overtime in Super Bowl 51, which allowed Brady to attempt the most passes ever thrown in a single title game. When all was said and done, he had thrown the ball 62 times for 466 yards that day.

They were worried for their colleagues' safety — some had already received security threats.

He had already tweeted again, telling followers they were patriots who would not be disrespected.\n\nLess than three hours after Gadde's emergency meeting, Twitter banned Trump forever. In an instant, the megaphone of the leader of the free world was wiped out, along with his following of 88 million he had built throughout his presidency — some of whom amplified his every word. And it brought to an end an era of free speech online that Twitter — which a senior executive once referred to as \"the free speech wing of the free speech party\" — had itself helped create.\n\nTwitter on Jan. 8 banned President Trump from its site, a punishment for his role in inciting violence at the U.S. Capitol.

Police said Laundrie was alone when he drove the van back to his parents' home in North Port, Florida, on Sept. 1.\n\nLaundrie has been identified as a person of interest in the case.

She'd struggled with crippling amounts of debt. Her home state of California was locking down again because of a virus she believed was fiction. Fast, informative and written just for locals. ArrowRight As she walked east along the Mall on Wednesday, wearing a backpack emblazoned with the American flag, Ashli Babbitt was elated.\n\n\"It was amazing to get to see the president talk,\" Babbitt said, beaming in a video she streamed on Facebook early Wednesday afternoon that was later published by TMZ. \"We are now walking down the inaugural path to the Capitol building. Three million-plus people.\"\n\nThere was no crowd of three million: just a mob, lawless and maskless, that numbered in the thousands. Babbitt's mission, which she had repeatedly avowed on social media, was to restore American democracy. But she was about to take part in a riot that would go down in history as one of that democracy's most grievous attacks.\n\nAfter a long but undistinguished military career and years of personal travails, Babbitt — a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from Southern California who once supported Barack Obama — believed she had found a cause that gave her life purpose. Within hours, that cause would bring her life to a violent end.\n\nHers was the first death reported Jan. 6, when rioters incited by President Trump overran the seat of the U.S. government. In the coming days there would be others. Brian D. Sicknick, a 42-year-old Capitol police officer who died after being injured while trying to push back the mob. Rosanne Boyland, Kevin D. Greeson and Benjamin Phillips, who died of medical emergencies during the chaos.\n\nBut it was Babbitt, fatally shot by police as she attempted to leap through the broken window of a door inside the Capitol, whose name would almost instantly become synonymous with the feverish movement that had propelled thousands of Americans to desecrate a pillar of their government.\n\nTo her comrades in the movement, she was a martyr. Back in California, Babbitt's brother, Roger Witthoeft, didn't even know she had attended the protest before their dad, distraught, called him with news of the shooting. He found a video online.\n\n\"There was no doubt that it was my beautiful sister,\" Witthoeft recalled.\n\nBabbitt's journey — illuminated through her extensive social media activity, court and military records, and interviews with some who knew her — was one of paranoid devotion and enthusiasm that only increased as Trump's fortunes waned.\n\nShe avidly followed the QAnon conspiracy theory, convinced that Trump was destined to vanquish a cabal of child abusers and Satan-worshiping Democrats. She believed Wednesday would be \"the storm,\" when QAnon mythology holds that Trump would capture and execute his opponents.\n\nLong before she embraced those ideas, Babbitt was on a rocky path. She was loyal but rebellious, devoted to her country but often unable to get along with those who shared it. A believer in American pluck and free enterprise, she struggled in her attempts to run a small pool-service company outside San Diego.\n\nShe served more than a decade in the armed forces but chafed under the military hierarchy. Six of those years were spent in an Air National Guard unit whose mandate is to defend the Washington region and respond to civil unrest. Its nickname: the Capital Guardians.\n\nLike so many others, she believed Jan. 6 would be not a day of infamy, but an end to her troubles.\n\n\"Nothing will stop us,\" she tweeted Jan. 5. \"They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!\"\n\nIt was the last thing she would write.\n\n'Absolutely unafraid'\n\nShe was fed up with her executive officer. It was 2014, and Babbitt — along with much of her Air National Guard unit, then stationed at the Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates — detested him, according to a former staff sergeant in the unit who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears backlash online.\n\nBut despite her reputation for being outspoken, she kept herself in check. Then one day, the executive officer slipped new papers into a briefing binder shortly before quizzing service members on its contents.\n\nBabbitt asked for permission to speak freely, the former staff sergeant said, and the executive officer granted it — \"which was a huge mistake for that captain.\""}

According to many news reports, the surface oil slicks near Port Fourchon (shown above) are likely related to as many as three damaged or ruptured submarine pipelines. It is unclear how much oil has spilled into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has conducted aerial surveys of some offshore waters and has released the photos online. The NASA-sponsored Delta-X research team has also been working in the area and was called upon to make some observations of the slicks and other coastal changes with synthetic aperture radar.\n\nBeyond active oil and gas extraction platforms, the seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico is covered in a maze of pipelines, capped wellheads, and other infrastructure that can be vulnerable to storm events. In a report issued earlier this year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office stated: \"Since the 1960s, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement has allowed the offshore oil and gas industry to leave 97 percent of pipelines (18,000 miles) on the seafloor when no longer in use.

The prosecution accused him of being in the wrong place for the wrong reasons and of carrying a gun to a volatile situation. Rittenhouse's lawyers defended him against a very different charge — namely, that he did not act in self-defense during the moments when he was confronted with a skateboard and a loaded gun.\n\nAnyone who watched biased commentators on CNN or MSNBC would have focused on the prosecution's charges. Anyone who watched the actual trial live would have understood that the case was far narrower and that the only issue was whether Rittenhouse reasonably feared for his life during the moments before he fired the shots that killed two men and wounded a third.\n\nHad he been tried for the prosecution's version of the crime, I would have judged him morally guilty. He never should have gone to Kenosha. He never should have armed himself. And he never should have gotten into a situation where he might have to use lethal force in self-defense.\n\nBut those were not the charges. And, indeed, they could not be the charges, because his actions – morally wrong as they may have been – were protected by the First and Second Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nHad I been on this jury, I would have found him not guilty because the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not act in self-defense. His testimony was believable. I believed that his tears were genuine when he testified and again when the verdict was rendered.\n\nViewers who actually saw his testimony could judge for themselves whether television newscasters and analysts, who in many instances prejudged the case, had correctly characterized his crying as white-privileged crocodile tears. That is why live coverage of trials is important: It serves as a check on biased commentators who cheer for certain outcomes and fail to objectively report on the facts. Observers who actually watched the trial were unlikely to be surprised at the outcome. But those who received their information filtered through biased commentators were likely to be shocked."}

He chased Mr. Rittenhouse into a parking lot and lunged at him and — according to Mr. Rittenhouse — reached for the barrel of his gun, after which Mr. Rittenhouse shot him. After that shooting, a group of protesters turned on Mr. Rittenhouse. Gaige Grosskreutz, who was shot by Mr. Rittenhouse but survived, had been armed with a handgun. He testified that he ran toward Mr. Rittenhouse and thought that he was \"an active shooter.\" While fleeing, Mr. Rittenhouse fell. Anthony Huber attacked him, hitting him with a skateboard, before Mr. Rittenhouse shot and killed him. Then Mr. Rittenhouse shot Mr. Grosskreutz after Mr. Grosskreutz pointed his gun at him and advanced. So the self-defense claim was, legally, not a stretch.\n\nMore arcane were the discussions regarding the charge of weapons possession. Adults can openly carry firearms in Wisconsin, but when it comes to minors, the law was confusing, even to the judge. Minors are not allowed to carry guns, but one subsection could be interpreted to exempt long rifles. A local attorney called it an \"extraordinarily poorly worded statute.\" But regardless of the clarity — or wisdom — of the law, once it was determined that the rifle that Mr. Rittenhouse carried to the protest had a 16-inch barrel, the judge dismissed the charge.\n\nOne could argue that if Mr. Rittenhouse had not brought a military-style semiautomatic weapon to a volatile situation, no one would be dead. But while this line of inquiry may be consistent with many people's moral intuition, and might even make good policy, it is not the law, and Wisconsin's law was not on trial.\n\nOther features of the Rittenhouse trial were not specific to Wisconsin, and were more representative of the perniciousness of the criminal legal system as a whole. An officer testified that after the shooting, Mr. Rittenhouse approached his car with his weapon strapped to his chest and his hands up in surrender, but officers ordered him to get out of the way and rushed past him to search for the shooter. Apparently, it did not enter their minds that the baby-faced white teen could be the culprit. So Mr. Rittenhouse went home, and ultimately turned himself in."}

Though it's common for courtrooms to use a lottery-type system to draw jurors or alternate jurors, it's often the courtroom clerk who physically draws the jurors' numbers.\n\n\"I am now reading about how bizarre and unusual it was to have the defendant pick numbers out of the tumbler yesterday,\" Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder said Wednesday, adding that he has made it standard practice to do so since a trial he oversaw in Racine, Wisconsin, roughly 20 years ago.\n\nSchroeder said the defendant in the Racine case was Black, and there was only one Black person in the pool of 13 jurors. He said when the clerk or government official drew the alternate, it happened to be the lone Black juror.\n\n\"There was nothing wrong with it — it was all okay, but what do they talk about? Optics nowadays? Is that the word for things? It was a bad optic, I thought,\" Schroeder said. \"I think people feel better when they have control, so ever since that case, I've had an almost universal policy of having the defendant do the picks.\"\n\nSchroeder noted that he'd never received a complaint about the practice — nor did he receive any pushback from the prosecutors or defense attorneys when he allowed Rittenhouse to draw the jurors. He suggested that some viewers of the trial — which has been streamed live in its entirety — were simply using the incident as an excuse to cast doubt on the eventual verdict.\n\n\"Some people seem to be dissatisfied with that. People who want to undermine the result of the trial,\" Schroeder said.\n\nRittenhouse is charged with killing two men and injuring a third amid civil unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, following the police shooting of Jacob Blake in August 2020.\n\nRittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to all charges, claiming he shot all three men in self-defense after they attacked him.\n\nSchroeder's remarks on Wednesday came amid a discussion about a note from the jury requesting to see certain videos that were played during the trial. Schroeder began discussing various complaints he'd read in the media about his decisions, including his decision to bar people from using the word \"victims\" to describe the men Rittenhouse shot — a standard rule upheld in courtrooms across the country."}

But the heavily fortified backdrop against which he'll take his oath of office will be a stark and surreal reminder of the challenges he'll face as he tries to make good on that promise of healing the deeply divided country.\n\nStill reeling from the Capitol attack Donald Trump set in motion January 6, Washington has been bracing for the potential for more MAGA violence, with a massive, multi-pronged security effort underway to protect the peaceful transfer of power—a hallmark of American democracy that has come under threat, thanks to Trump's refusal, to the bitter end, to acknowledge his election loss. True to form, Trump won't be attending his successor's inauguration—not that anyone really wants to see him glowering behind Biden the whole ceremony anyway—but there is significant concern that some of his ardent supporters might try.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the FBI on Monday tipped off law enforcement agencies to the threat of QAnon cultists descending on D.C. for the inauguration, possibly disguised as National Guard troops. \"QAnon members have discussed posing as National Guard soldiers, believing that it would be easy for them to infiltrate secure areas,\" the bureau said in an intelligence report, the Post reported. Devotees to the deranged conspiracy theory, which holds that Trump has been waging a secret war on a Democratic cabal of cannibal sex traffickers, were among the crowd of MAGA extremists who stormed the Capitol earlier this month as lawmakers formalized Biden's victory. While the FBI did not identify any specific plots against the inauguration on the scale of that siege, it is warning that Q adherents have been scheming up ways to disrupt Wednesday's ceremony, including by exploiting vulnerabilities in the capital city's security blanket and by blending in with the more than 20,000 troops that have been mobilized. The bureau is also warning of \"lone wolf\" threats to the ceremony.\n\n\"We're monitoring all incoming leads, whether they're calls for armed protest, potential threats that grow out of the January 6 breach of the Capitol, or other kinds of potential threats leading up to inaugural events and in various other targets,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said last week.\n\nThe threats of further violence has already made for a tense transition of power. But the possibility of insurrectionists posing as security forces could make the effort to protect the event even more complicated—especially amid ongoing concerns about extremists within law enforcement and the military. The radicals who converged on Capitol Hill January 6 included several people with a history of service, including Ashli Babbitt, who was killed in the riot and has become something of a martyr to the pro-Trump right. The Associated Press reported Tuesday that two Army National Guard members \"are being removed from the security mission\" at the inauguration because they are said to \"have been found to have ties to fringe right group militias.\""}

He rose to the rank of four-star general in the Army before becoming the first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And under former President George W.

He was 43. But he knew his golf history as well as he knew the famed layout at Augusta National, where he had won four times, and set the record straight.\n\n\"One of the greatest comebacks in all of sports is the gentleman who won here, Mr. Hogan,\" Woods said of Ben Hogan, a two-time Masters winner who is universally revered and always referred to as \"Mr. Hogan.\" Never \"Ben.\"\n\nWoods continued, \"I mean, he got hit by a bus and came back and won major championships. The pain he had to endure, the things he had to do just to play, the wrapping of the leg, all the hot tubs, and just how hard it was for him to walk, period ... One of the greatest comebacks there is and it happens to be in our sport.\"\n\nWoods won the tournament.\n\nBen Hogan has been dead for nearly a quarter-century, but his name has been trending this week in the wake of Woods' horrible car accident in California. Woods wasn't even out of surgery before speculation arose about another Tiger comeback, this time maybe even bigger than Hogan's. Woods is being held to a very high standard — that of the man who returned from a near-death experience to win seven majors in the next four years.\n\nThe two are inextricably linked both by history and success. Hogan was the dominant player of his era, which spanned from the early 1940s to the mid-1950s. Likewise, Woods ruled the golf world for more than a decade. Woods won more majors, but Hogan only competed in the British Open once (he won) and stopped participating in the PGA after winning it for a second time in 1948.

Remember: WhatsApp wasn't created by Facebook. It was an independent success. FB got scared & bought it. ...

The judge overseeing the case has until mid-November to respond.\n\nFacebook has continually used its vast cash reserves to absorb potential competitors, giving Mark Zuckerberg's company tendrils across the internet. The company's dominance also means that its content moderation policies — set by a company with its eye seemingly on its bottom line, rather than public benefit — can have major consequences for the national discourse. Those rules, and Facebook's role in setting them, have become increasingly important as foreign and domestic groups exploit them to spread misinformation and propaganda.\n\nFacebook, Instagram, WhatsApp have been down since noon Monday, likely due to an issue with Facebook's Domain Name System, which is basically the phonebook of the internet.

They were then able to shut down the servers from the inside.\n\n\"REvil...restored the infrastructure from the backups under the assumption that they had not been compromised,\" said Oleg Skulkin, an official at the Russian security company Group-IB. \"Ironically, the gang's own favorite tactic of compromising the backups was turned against them.\"\n\nReuters described REvil as \"one of the worst of dozens of ransomware gangs that work with hackers to penetrate and paralyze companies around the world.\"\n\nThe hacking of the Colonial Pipeline by REvil and another ransomware group, DarkSide, led to massive gasoline shortages and caused President Joe Biden to declare a state of emergency in 17 states.\n\nThe pipeline ended up being under siege for six days. This caused panic buying of fuel across numerous states, and The Washington Post reported that the average gallon of gas rose to its highest price since 2014.\n\nAn energy official told Politico at the time that it was the \"most significant, successful attack on energy infrastructure we know of in the United States.\"\n\nThe pipeline was eventually restored, but only after the pipeline's owner, Colonial Pipeline Company, sent REvil and DarkSide $4.4 million.\n\nREvil made headlines again in July when it hacked into software management company Kaseya, allowing the group to access the personal information of hundreds of the company's clients.\n\nThey demanded a large ransom from Kaseya as well.

About 12% of global trade dependent on effective transit through the Suez Canal which provides the shortest connection between Asia and Europe. Growing concerns have been raised about the effect of the World's largest maritime hold-up on the global economy, and Nigeria may not be left out.\n\nThe Suez Canal can be seen as a major artery to global trade, and with the effects of the Covid19 pandemic still wearing off, the world may not be able to afford continuous interruptions to globalization. The Ever Given cargo ship is substantially bigger than the Eiffel tower and the empire state building. The ship is 400 meters long and wedged diagonally across a canal that is not more than 200metres wide.\n\nIn 2017, a Japanese container vessel blocked the canal due to some mechanical issues by which the response from the Egyptian authorities was swift in developing tug boats to rectify the situation, in hours. However, regular measures have yielded sub-optimal results. According to the Suez Canal authorities, nearly 9000 ships pass through the canal in 2020, averaging 51.5 ships per day.\n\nInformation contained in a Bloomberg report reveals the breakthrough in the rescue attempt came after diggers removed 27,000 cubic meters of sand, going deep into the banks of the canal.

Companies will lose money as goods won't be able to get to final consumers. Increase in demurrage leads to a high cost of the product. For a supplier that has a fixed price, the deal might end up being losing transaction. We will also experience a higher cost of freight as vessels/ships will have to take the longer route.

And we're outraged as well as heartbroken.\n\nBeing the father of an Army major who served for a year in Iraq and, before that, was in Kosovo as a U.S. attorney for the better part of six months in the middle of a war — when he came home after a year in Iraq, he was diagnosed, like many, many coming home, with an aggressive and lethal cancer of the brain — who we lost.\n\nWe have some sense, like many of you do, what the families of these brave heroes are feeling today.

That obligation is not temporary; it lasts forever.\n\nThe lives we lost today were lives given in the service of liberty, the service of security, in the service of others, in the service of America.\n\nLike their fellow brothers and sisters in arms who died defending our vision and our values in the struggle against terrorism of — the fallen this day, they're part of a great and noble company of American heroes.\n\nTo those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command.\n\nOver the past few weeks — I know you're — many of you are probably tired of hearing me say it — we've been made aware by our intelligence community that the ISIS-K — an arch-enemy of the Taliban; people who were freed when both those prisons were opened — has been planning a complex set of attacks on the United States personnel and others.\n\nThis is why, from the outset, I've repeatedly said this mission was extraordinarily dangerous and why I have been so determined to limit the duration of this mission.\n\nAnd as General McKenzie said, this is why our mission was designed — this is the way it was designed to operate: operate under severe stress and attack. We've known that from the beginning.\n\nAnd as I've been in constant contact with our senior military leaders — and I mean constant, around the clock — and our commanders on the ground and throughout the day, they made it clear that we can and we must complete this mission, and we will. And that's what I've ordered them to do.\n\nWe will not be deterred by terrorists. We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation.\n\nI've also ordered my commanders to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership, and facilities. We will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose, and the moment of our choosing.\n\nHere is what you need to know: These ISIS terrorists will not win. We will rescue the Americans who are there. We will get out our Afghan allies out, and our mission will go on.\n\nAmerica will not be intimidated.\n\nI have the utmost confidence in our brave service members who continue to execute this mission with courage and honor to save lives and get Americans, our partners, our Afghan allies out of Afghanistan.\n\nEvery day when I talk to our commanders, I ask them what they need — what more do they need, if anything, to get the job done.

In the first hour of Thursday, he saw around 100 cars, including one person with a flatbed trailer that had collected their entire neighborhood's trash cans.\n\nRyan Nelsen Vehicles line up to drop off trash at the Elysian Fields Transfer Station, on Thursday, Sept. 16, 2021.\n\nThe city's trash collection agency Metro Service Group had fallen behind on collections before Ida as well. Workers for the agency held a strike in May 2020 for a higher salary than $10.25 and protection equipment against COVID-19.\n\nIn a press release Wednesday, Cantrell said that staffing remains an issue due to the national labor shortage due to the pandemic.\n\nThe city has contracted Ramelli Waste, LLC, from Kenner to aid Richard's Disposal Inc., and Metro Services Group is getting the help of seven trucks from IV Waste. But city officials said that finding additional outside bidders has been difficult. On Wednesday, the city extended the contract three days in hopes of finding more bids.\n\nNo getting around it: The situation stinks!!️\n\nAt its core, this is a capacity issue. There was a limited workforce for this sector before the storm, and Ida's impact only exacerbated the problem.\n\nEven before Ida, residents in the Bywater say they were only seeing Metro trash collectors around twice a month. After Ida's landfall in late August, many in the neighborhood have not had their trash collected even once."}

At the moment, the extra spot goes to the linebackers, with outside linebacker Cam Gill and rookie inside linebackers K.J. Britt and Grant Stuard all making it.\n\nThe Buccaneers retained six of their seven 2021 draft picks, with the exception being seventh-round cornerback Chris Wilcox. The only undrafted rookie still on the roster after Tuesday's cuts is kicker Jose Borregales, who handled the placekicking duties in the preseason finale at Houston with Succop unavailable.\n\nListed below is how the initial 53-man roster breaks down, with the players listed alphabetically at each position (rookies marked with an asterisk). We've also included the four players currently on the reserve/COVID-19 list, some or all of whom could be activated to the 53-man roster in the coming week.\n\nQuarterbacks (3): Tom Brady, Blaine Gabbert, Kyle Trask*\n\nThe Buccaneers kept Trask, a second-round draft pick and possibly an eventual successor to Brady, over long-tenured but little-used veteran Ryan Griffin. Gabbert is likely to be the primary reserve for Brady in 2021, however.\n\nRunning Backs (4): Giovani Bernard, Leonard Fournette, Ronald Jones, Ke'Shawn Vaughn\n\nOne of the few new veterans on the roster, Bernard appears to have carved out a significant role as a third-down back, while Fournette and Jones remain essentially co-starters. Vaughn, the 2020 third-round pick, helped his cause for the fourth spot in the backfield by finding a role on special teams as a gunner.\n\nWide Receivers (6): Antonio Brown, Jaelon Darden*, Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Tyler Johnson, Scotty Miller\n\nThere was little surprise in the top five receivers retained with the starting trio of Evans, Godwin and Brown backed up by promising young players Johnson and Miller. Darden appears to have beaten out Jaydon Mickens for the return job, thus securing the sixth spot. The Bucs cut Mickens, Cyril Grayson and Travis Jonsen to get down to six and any or all of those three could be top candidates for the practice squad.\n\nTight Ends (3): Cameron Brate, Rob Gronkowski, O.J. Howard\n\nNeither Hudson nor McElroy apparently offered enough as a blocker or a special teams player to prompt the Bucs to keep a fourth tight end, though both are strong pass-catchers and could stick around on the practice squad. With both Howard and Brate coming off injuries and Gronkowski coming off his first-ever 20-game season, the Bucs will likely keep some depth on that secondary unit.\n\nOffensive Linemen (9): Alex Cappa, Robert Hainsey*, Ryan Jensen, Ali Marpet, John Molchon, Donovan Smith, Aaron Stinnie, Josh Wells, Tristan Wirfs, (Nick Leverett and Earl Watford – COVID list)"}

In the United Kingdom, the interview aired on ITV on Monday, March 8, at 9 p.m., and streamed simultaneously on the ITV Hub, where it can still be watched.\n\nOprah's interview with Harry and Meghan was pre-taped, and CBS teased preview clips over the past several days.\n\nFor those who didn't watch Sunday, the interview is streaming on CBS.com. And CNN has plenty of analysis.\n\nWhy did Oprah interview Harry and Meghan?\n\nOprah is friendly with the couple: She attended Harry and Meghan's wedding in May 2018, and Winfrey helped the couple get settled in the community. She previously partnered with Harry on a mental health documentary for Apple TV+.\n\nOprah has longstanding business ties with CBS, but she maintained control of the interview all along via her production company, Harpo. Her company crafted the interview plan and brought it to CBS.\n\nWinfrey is one of the most renowned interviewers in the world. Sunday night's broadcast which could lift the lid on a litany of frustrations and grievances held by the couple against the royal institution they quit last year.\n\nHarpo and CBS announced the US premiere, and then the global distribution arm of ViacomCBS Global lined up other international broadcasters from Australia to Switzerland.\n\nWhy did the interview take place now?\n\nThe couple has mostly kept quiet about a sea of controversy surrounding their contentious relationship with the royal family, but they appear ready to speak out.\n\n\"(The Duchess) and the Duke are due to speak openly and honestly about their experience of recent years,\" Harry and Meghan's spokesperson said in a statement last week.\n\nStill, the interview has been years in the making: Although the CBS interview was announced on February 15, in a preview clip released Friday, Oprah said she spoke to Meghan about a potential interview three years ago in February or March 2018 — even before the royal wedding.\n\n\"I remember that conversation very well,\" Meghan said. \"I wasn't even allowed to have that conversation with you personally, right.\" She indicated that Buckingham Palace communications staff was present.\n\n\"I couldn't have said yes to you then,\" Meghan said. \"That wasn't my choice to make. So, as an adult who lived a really independent life — to then go into this construct that is... different than I think what people imagine it to be — it's really liberating to be able to have the right and the privilege in some ways to be able to say yes. I mean... I'm ready to talk.\"\n\nWhy is this interview important?\n\nIn January 2020, Harry and Meghan announced that they were stepping back from their roles as senior royals in a move that apparently surprised the royal family. And on February 19, 2021, just weeks before the Oprah interview was set to air, the Buckingham Palace announced that Harry and Meghan agreed with Queen Elizabeth II that they will not be returning as working members of the British royal family.\n\nThere has been tension between the couple and the palace for years now, and the duo is expected to unveil some revealing details about their experiences."}

We'll turn back the clock (and then look ahead) at five of the biggest talkers of the year.\n\nStories of 2021: Pro golf is at an inflection point. But what's next?\n\nThrough triumph and tumult, Tiger Woods' career has been a textbook filled with lessons in perspective. But none hit harder than the news out of Southern California, on the morning of Feb. 23 this year.\n\nThis was not back surgery, or tabloid scandal, or a comeback run to another major. This was a more elemental moment: a once-in-a-lifetime golfer in a brush with death.\n\nUnlike his prior headline-making mishaps at the wheel — one a run-in with a hydrant, the other a mugshot-yielding DUI — the terrifying crash, on a curvy road near Rancho Palo Verdes, brought no mockery from pundits, no media scorn. Only words of sympathy and respect.\n\nOn Tour that weekend, players took the tee wearing Tiger red.\n\n\"I'm sick to my stomach,\" Justin Thomas said.\n\n\"You think guys like Tiger and Kobe Bryant are untouchable,\" added Adam Scott, crystalizing a conclusion that seemed lost on no one. \"But they're not.\"\n\nFor those seeking answers to lingering questions — What about the blood work? Why no charges? Had law enforcement granted Tiger special treatment? — the sheriff's accident report left much unanswered. But as Woods returned to Florida to recoup in private, there was largely willingness to let matters lie. Life, and golf, went on.\n\nFour majors. A Ryder Cup. A Brooks and Bryson sideshow. A season passed, and Woods remained conspicuous in his absence, with word of his condition coming second hand through pals like Thomas and Rickie Fowler.\n\nIn advance of the Masters, Rory McIlroy paid a visit and reported finding Tiger in \"decent spirits.\"\n\n\"When you hear of these things and you look at the car and you see the crash, it's like, you think he's going to be in a hospital bed for six months,\" McIlroy said. \"But he was actually doing better than that.\"\n\nThe morsels of info mostly underscored how much he was missed.\n\nAnd then, in late November, eight months after he'd been plied from the wreckage, an update from the man himself: the first post-crash video of Woods hitting shots.\n\n\"Making progress,\" the internet-rocking caption read.\n\nLess than two weeks later, when he showed up in the flesh in the Bahamas, as tournament host and star of the year's most closely watched range session, there was speculation, and, soon after, confirmation: a year that opened in near calamity would close with a heart-warming hit and giggle: Woods would ease back into action by pegging it in Florida alongside his son.\n\nThough the PNC Championship was all about good feelings, Team Woods also played good golf — 11 consecutive birdies in one stretch, a performance that was catnip for prognosticators. Would he, could he, compete on Tour again? Might he make a go at another Masters? It was understandable, all the future tripping. Woods, as ever, was stirring up excitement.\n\nBut really, what he'd given us was cause for reflection.\n\nA cop responding to the accident had been the first to say, and Tiger himself would repeat it later: he was lucky to be alive."}

The trial went on for two weeks of he-said-she-said. There was a mountain of evidence to pore over but not one drop of blood to see.\n\nTrump's second impeachment trial was a steroidal sequel centered on the rage, violence and anguish of one day in Washington. There was nothing foreign or far away about it. There was blood.\n\nTogether these trials a year apart spoke to one president's singular capacity to get into, and out of, trouble — the story of Trump's life. The only president to be impeached twice has once again evaded consequences, though this time as an election loser shunted off the field of play to the jeering section, at least for now.\n\nIn a broadside against Trump every bit as brutal as that leveled by Democrats, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell declared the ex-president \"practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day\" with his \"unconscionable behavior\" and \"disgraceful dereliction of duty.\"\n\n\"The leader of the free world cannot spend two weeks thundering that shadowy forces are stealing our country and then feign surprise when people believe them and do reckless things,\" McConnell said.\n\nBut this was after he gave Trump an escape hatch for the ages, voting to acquit him on the grounds that the Senate, in his view, cannot legitimately try a president out of office.\n\nUntil the conclusion of the five-day trial, the noisiest man in America stayed silent, down in Florida. But the panic, terrified whispers of officials hiding from their attackers and the crack of a fatal gunshot played out on a big screen in the Senate chamber penetrated less than six weeks earlier by the Trump-flag-waving insurrectionists.\n\nThis time the case did not hang on a whistleblower in the bowels of the national security bureaucracy.\n\nThis was an impeachment driven by what people saw happen and by Trump's voluminous public rhetoric, heard that day, for weeks before, and after — until Twitter exiled him and he let his lawyers and supporters do the talking while the trial played out.\n\n\"We saw it, we heard it, we lived it,\" said the Democratic majority leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer. \"This was the first presidential impeachment trial in history in which all senators were not only jurors and judges but were witnesses to the constitutional crime that was committed.\"\n\nTrump's fanciful boast five years ago that he could shoot someone in the middle of New York's Fifth Avenue and still be loved by his followers was never, of course, put to the test in his presidency. But something like it was, on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nOn Jan. 6, he sent his followers down that street to the Capitol, where they committed their mayhem. And in the end, that did not cost him the loyalty of enough supporters in Congress to convict him on the charge of inciting an insurrection."}

These critics maintain that our commitment to the First Amendment should solely trigger a defense of the president's \"free speech.\" But freedom of speech poses no bar to holding a president responsible for his unfounded, bad-faith effort to subvert the results of a free and fair election.\n\nOur board — comprised of leading lawyers and activists from every state and the District of Columbia — is a thoughtful, deliberative body of committed civil libertarians. After meetings on both Saturday and Sunday, the ACLU board unanimously passed a resolution again calling for President Trump's impeachment, which can be found here.\n\nWe discussed at length the free speech implications of this impeachment process. We concluded that President Trump's remarks on Jan. 6 can be considered part of a pattern of efforts to upend an election he lost. If a president's repeated lies, illegal political pressure, and the stoking of a mob to subvert the democratic process are not an abuse of power warranting impeachment, it is difficult to know what would be.\n\nHolding the president accountable for his words on Jan. 6, as part of that pattern, does not run afoul of the First Amendment. The House impeachment resolution reflects this. It does not single out Trump's speech on Jan. 6 inciting a mob, but rather identifies it as part of a pattern of \"efforts to subvert and obstruct the certification results of the 2020 presidential election,\" including the improper pressure placed on Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger \"to 'find' enough votes to overturn the Georgia presidential election results and threatened Mr. Raffensperger if he failed to do so.\"\n\nThe ACLU believes a president can be impeached for speech that a private citizen could not be prosecuted for.\n\nFirst, proceedings to impeach and remove a president are not criminal proceedings. They specifically seek to remove the president from office. While the First Amendment would likely bar the criminal conviction of a private citizen for the president's Jan. 6 speech, impeachment is a political remedy: to remove an executive official who has abused his office, not to convict them of a criminal offense. The Supreme Court has long held that public employees can be fired for on-the-job speech that would be fully protected from criminal prosecution. Whether the president has any First Amendment rights when speaking in his capacity as president has never been established. At a minimum, because of his role and authority, the president does not have the same freedom of speech as an ordinary citizen.\n\nThe First Amendment doesn't protect the rights of public employees to say whatever they want when speaking in their official capacity. As a matter of law, public employees are regularly sanctioned for speech that fosters a hostile work environment. Their public position imbues their speech with more influence than the average citizen — as the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. It follows that President Trump doesn't have unfettered free speech rights to subvert the results of a fair and free election. In short, a president who recklessly urged his followers to violate the law could be impeached even if an ordinary citizen could not be convicted for the same words, absent proof that his speech was intended and likely to produce imminent lawless action."}

While practicing a scene, actor Alec Baldwin discharged a prop gun that he was told did not contain live rounds, according to affidavits shared by the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office. Hutchins was rushed to a nearby hospital via helicopter, where she died.\n\nDirector Joel Souza, who was standing behind Hutchins at the time, was shot in the shoulder but survived. The shooting remains under investigation.\n\nIn a statement shared via Twitter, Baldwin called Hutchins' death a \"tragic accident\" that left him heartbroken. Speaking to Variety, Johnson echoed that sentiment.\n\n\"First of all, I was heartbroken,\" Johnson said. \"We lost a life. My heart goes out to her family and everybody on set. I've known Alec, too, for a very long time.\"\n\nJohnson's interview comes ahead of the release of his latest project, Netflix's Red Notice, an action film slated to hit the streaming service later this month. While Johnson did have to handle real guns during the shooting of that film, it was within hours after hearing the news about Hutchins that he began planning how to make his own projects safer, he told Variety."}

That was tough to watch. Poor Detective Colin Zabel, a character we had grown so fond of, took an abrupt bullet to the head in the final confrontation of episode five, with two more episodes of the series to go. Feeling gutted by his death? That's just what actor Evan Peters and series director Craig Zobel were going for.\n\nEven up to his final day of shooting, Peters was finding new ways for Colin to worm his way into our hearts. In the latest episode of our podcast Still Watching: Mare of Easttown, Peters digs into his connection to Colin, and why a certain scene left him \"hysterically sobbing\" in his director's arms.\n\nYou can listen to the entire Evan Peters interview here, and read highlights of our conversation below.\n\nWhen series creator Brad Ingelsby first conceived of Colin Zabel, he thought of the character as a brash, hotshot detective-type who, despite the secret he's holding about the case in Upper Darby, would walk into Mare's office like he owned the joint. You can see traces of that take in costume designer Meghan Kasperlik's wardrobe for the character. \"He's trying to dress to look good,\" Zobel said. \"Dark suits and stuff.\" Zobel liked the contrast: \"I thought it was a brilliant, you know, he was dressed like the guy who could do the hotshot detective, but he just wasn't.\"\n\nPeters even took pool lessons, to give that version of the character something to show off. In the end, perhaps it was a relief Zabel got an overhaul: \"Pool! I never used it, never got good at it!\"\n\nWhat Peters, Zobel, and Ingelsby landed on, instead, was a new vision for Zabel: an earnest young man caught in a state of arrested development and suffering from a crippling case of imposter syndrome. Zabel taking credit for a case he didn't actually solve, Peters said, \"was just the worst possible thing that he could do. Now he feels like a total imposter. You could play it where he's overly confident trying to make up for that. Or you could play it like he's totally insecure and has severe imposter syndrome, and has no idea what he's doing. I can relate more to that than the other one.\""}

More than 1 million customers were without electricity immediately after the storm - a hardship that, for some, could last weeks.\n\nEntergy Corp (ETR.N) the largest Louisiana utility, is facing tough questions on whether it had done enough to harden the electric system, which lost eight major transmission lines delivering power to the New Orleans metropolitan area.\n\nEntergy was in the midst of upgrades throughout its system after Hurricane Laura in 2020. From 2017 to 2019, Entergy's Louisiana subsidiary spent about $1.2 billion on numerous projects to improve its transmission system.\n\nA pivotal question now for Entergy and its consumers is how well those capital improvements survived the hurricane's wrath compared to the company's older infrastructure. Entergy declined to detail the age of the eight New Orleans-area transmission lines that failed.\n\n\"The reason the lights are out is not because we aren't building a resilient system,\" said Rod West, Entergy's group president of utility operations. \"The lights are out because Mother Nature is still the undisputed, undefeated heavyweight champion of the world.\"\n\nHurricane Laura in southwest Louisiana highlighted how Entergy operates a transmission network with two different design standards for resisting wind damage. Transmission lines and infrastructure built in recent years are rated to withstand 140-mph winds, and in some cases up to 150 mph gusts, according to Entergy disclosures with Louisiana utility regulators.\n\nBut large sections of Entergy's Louisiana network were designed to withstand wind speeds far below what Ida delivered. About one-sixth of Entergy Louisiana's transmission system, covering about 900 miles, consists of 69-kilovolt lines, the majority of which are only rated at 95 mph, according to Entergy disclosures to regulators.\n\nThe 1970s-era design standard, which was used in building part of the network that feeds New Orleans, is a holdover from when Gulf States Utilities operated the transmission system, according to Entergy disclosures to Louisiana regulators.\n\nMany structures on the legacy system were destroyed last year during Hurricane Laura, according to testimony submitted by Entergy executives this year to the Louisiana Public Service Commission. The company has asked regulators to approve more than $500 million to repair and rebuild damaged transmission lines from 2020 hurricanes, a cost that would be shouldered by ratepayers in their monthly electric bills.\n\nThree years after Entergy merged with Gulf States in 1994, the company implemented a more robust design for the transmission network that met or exceeded the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) standard. But the network still includes lines built to the older, lower standard because they complied with NESC codes at the time they were constructed.\n\nThat leaves the network more vulnerable to outages, said Praveen Malhotra, an engineer and expert on catastrophe risk who has studied hurricane effects on transmission systems.\n\n\"The whole system is only as strong as the weakest link,\" Malhotra said.\n\nEntergy said in a statement that much of the damage from Ida was related to the high winds, causing several lines to become detached from their structures. The eight transmission tie lines that were rendered inoperable are vital because they connect the integrated transmission system in the greater New Orleans area to the larger national grid."}

Woods also told deputies twice that he didn't remember how the crash occurred and didn't even remember driving after surviving the crash with broken bones in his right leg.\n\nSuch clues, including the lack of braking evidence on the road, have led experts to question two particular sheriff-department decisions as the investigation remains ongoing:\n\n- To frame the crash as an \"accident\" right away. Hours after the crash, the sheriff and the deputy who responded to the 911 call both emphasized the downhill road as a potential cause.\n\n- To not bring in a drug-recognition expert (DRE), a law enforcement officer who is trained to identify clues of impairment and determine whether the driver should have his blood examined for medications or other drugs. Calling on a DRE can be routine in serious crash investigations, but it is up to each agency in charge.\n\n\"LASD is not releasing any further information at this time,\" the sheriff's department said in a statement Friday. \"The traffic collision investigation is ongoing and traffic investigators continue to work to determine the cause of the collision.\"\n\nWoods' agent, Mark Steinberg, didn't return a message seeking comment.\n\nAccident reconstruction experts said Woods' inability to remember driving at all was reason enough to bring in a DRE, if only to be thorough in the investigation.\n\n\"Exactly, exactly,\" said Charles Schack, a former New Hampshire state police trooper who is now president of Crash Experts, which analyzes traffic accidents for law firms and insurance companies. \"I would have thought that you would have him evaluated by a DRE to see whether or not there are some physical clues beyond the operation that would point to impairment. To an untrained person, sometimes the effects are a bit more subtle, and require a bit more in-depth examination to bring out the evidence of impairment.\"\n\nDREs don't automatically call for blood to be examined. They instead make a determination of whether it's necessary at the end of a 12-step process. That protocol can take place away from the crash scene, and it includes questioning the driver about medications and examining the driver's eyes and vital signs.\n\nA day after the crash, Villanueva gave the following reason for not bringing a DRE into the Woods case a day earlier:\n\n\"The deputy at the scene assessed the condition of Tiger Woods and there was no evidence of any impairment whatsoever,\" Villanueva said. \"He was lucid, no odor of alcohol, no evidence of any medication, narcotics or anything like that would bring that into question. So that was not a concern at the time. So therefore, obviously no field sobriety test and no DRE.\""}
