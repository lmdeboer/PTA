One such claim suggested that he had enjoyed a \"two-week, all-expenses-paid vacation\" at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Let's fact-check this claim.\n\nClaim: Kyle Rittenhouse Had a 'Two-Week, All-Expenses-Paid Vacation' at Mar-a-Lago\n\nRittenhouse's trial concluded on November 19, 2021, with the jury finding him not guilty on all charges. Shortly after the verdict, rumors began circulating online that Rittenhouse had been invited for a lengthy stay at Mar-a-Lago. The claim gained traction on social media, amassing thousands of shares.\n\nHowever, the facts do not support this claim. Mark Richards, Rittenhouse's lead defense attorney, confirmed to USA TODAY that Rittenhouse had visited Florida and Mar-a-Lago the weekend after his trial for an interview. Richards did not, however, specify the length of Rittenhouse's stay.\n\nTrump's Spokesperson Confirms Meeting with Rittenhouse\n\nLiz Harrington, Trump's spokesperson, acknowledged the meeting between Rittenhouse and Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Harrington tweeted a photo of Rittenhouse and Trump together, along with the caption, \"President Trump met with Kyle Rittenhouse and his mother last night at Mar-a-Lago. Kyle is a free man, cleared of all charges related to Kenosha.\"\n\nTrump also mentioned the meeting during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on November 22, 2021. Trump stated that Rittenhouse was a fan and wanted to say hello. Trump further mentioned that Rittenhouse had left Mar-a-Lago a few days after the verdict.\n\nRittenhouse's Attorney Clarifies Misinformation\n\nRichards also addressed the misinformation regarding Rittenhouse's stay at Mar-a-Lago during an interview with CNN. He stated that the claim of a two-week vacation is incorrect but did not specify the length of Rittenhouse's stay.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the available information, the claim that Kyle Rittenhouse had a 'two-week, all-expenses-paid vacation' at Mar-a-Lago is rated as false. Rittenhouse did visit Florida and Mar-a-Lago for a few days at most after his trial to meet with Trump and give interviews. There is no evidence to support the claim of a lengthy, all-expenses-paid stay."}

Leonard Fournette, the Buccaneers' running back, shared insights into Brady's pivotal role in their triumph.\n\nFournette described Brady's pregame speech as a powerful message of motivation, focusing on playing for honor and the significance of players' last names. \"Tom gave us a speech before the game, and it was just about playing for something bigger than ourselves,\" Fournette said. \"He reminded us of the importance of our last names and the legacy we're leaving behind.\"\n\nBrady, a six-time champion with the New England Patriots, secured his seventh title in his 10th Super Bowl appearance. Fournette, who signed with the Buccaneers before the season started, played a key role in the playoffs, scoring important touchdowns, including one in the Super Bowl.\n\nThroughout the week leading up to the Super Bowl, Brady boosted the team's morale by sending positive texts every morning. \"Tom's messages were always positive and uplifting,\" Fournette said. \"He kept our spirits high and helped us stay focused on the goal.\"\n\nFournette expressed admiration for Brady, noting it was special to play alongside someone he considered a great. \"Tom's a legend in this league, and it's an honor to be on the same team as him,\" Fournette said. \"He's a true professional, and his work ethic is unmatched.\"\n\nThe Buccaneers team, according to Fournette, has potential for more achievements. \"We have the talent and the organizational support to 'run it back' in 2021,\" Fournette expressed. Currently, Fournette is set to become a free agent, but the sentiment towards the Buccaneers and the experience playing with Brady is quite positive.\n\nFournette acknowledged the team's triumph was a collective effort. \"It wasn't just Tom or one player that carried us to the win,\" Fournette said. \"It was a complete team effort, and everyone contributed in their own way.\"\n\nBrady's influence extended beyond the pregame speech. Throughout the season, the veteran quarterback mentored the younger players, instilling a sense of discipline and determination. \"Tom's leadership was invaluable to us,\" Fournette said. \"His work ethic and dedication set the tone for the entire team.\"\n\nThe Super Bowl victory marked a significant milestone for both Brady and the Buccaneers. Brady became the oldest starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl, while the Buccaneers became the first team to play and win a Super Bowl in their home stadium.\n\nBrady's impact on the Buccaneers was felt both on and off the field. His leadership and competitive spirit resonated with the team, fueling their determination to succeed. \"Tom's competitive fire is contagious,\" Fournette said. \"He raised the bar for all of us, and we responded by giving everything we had on the field.\"\n\nFournette's performance in the Super Bowl was a testament to his resilience and versatility. He finished the game with 11 carries for 61 yards and one touchdown. \"I'm just grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the team's success,\" Fournette said. \"I gave it my all, and I'm proud of what we accomplished together.\"\n\nAs the Buccaneers celebrate their Super Bowl victory, the future remains uncertain for some players, including Fournette, who is set to become a free agent. However, he expressed openness to staying in Tampa and continuing the team's winning tradition. \"I love it here in Tampa, and I'd be honored to be a part of this team again next season,\" Fournette said. \"We have the potential to accomplish great things, and I want to be a part of that.\""}

The incident underscores the urgent need for effective threat assessment teams in schools, as educators and mental health professionals grapple with identifying students who might commit acts of violence.\n\n\"There's no profile of a student who's going to be violent,\" warns Dewey Cornell, a professor of education and psychology at the University of Virginia. \"The vast majority of students who threaten violence don't actually carry it out, but we can't tell which ones will.\"\n\nSchool counselors and teachers are under immense pressure to spot warning signs, but they face numerous challenges. \"It's difficult to distinguish between students who are troubled and those who are potentially dangerous,\" admits Melissa Reeves, the former president of the National Association of School Psychologists.\n\nIn response, schools are increasingly relying on sophisticated threat detection systems. These methods include examining social media, assessing students' access to weapons, and utilizing mental health professionals.\n\nHowever, the tragic mass shooting at Oxford High School in Michigan, where Ethan Crumbley was not removed from class despite alarming behavior, has highlighted potential shortcomings in identifying and acting upon threats.\n\n\"We need multidisciplinary teams to assess threats, including administrators, mental health professionals, and school-based police officers,\" emphasizes Michele Gay, co-founder of Safe and Sound Schools, a nonprofit organization dedicated to school safety.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service and FBI endorse threat assessment methods to prevent mass shootings at schools. In fact, Virginia became the first state to mandate threat assessment teams after the 2007 Virginia Tech mass shooting, which left 32 people dead.\n\nBy 2017, about half of American secondary schools and more than 40% of primary schools had implemented threat assessment teams. Yet, despite these efforts, making accurate threat assessments remains a challenge.\n\nTracy Ogren, a school psychologist in the Robbinsdale Area Schools in Minnesota, explains, \"There's a lot of gray area when it comes to assessing threats. We have to be very careful not to label students as potential threats unnecessarily.\"\n\nRobyn Lady, the director of student services for Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia, echoes Ogren's sentiments. \"We take every threat seriously, but we also understand that many students make threats without intending to carry them out,\" she says.\n\nExperts stress the importance of student and teacher awareness of warning signs. \"Educators and students need to be trained to recognize the signs of potential violence and report them to school administrators,\" says Katherine Schweit, a former FBI special agent and author of \"A Mother's Reckoning: Living in the Aftermath of Tragedy.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, threat assessment teams offer a crucial line of defense against school violence. By combining the expertise of mental health professionals, educators, and law enforcement, these teams can help prevent tragedies like the one at Oxford High School."}

(AP) – The chaotic scene at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, as a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building, was the result of years of hateful rhetoric, stoked by disinformation and conspiracy theories, experts on far-right extremism warned.\n\nAmy Spitalnick, executive director of Integrity First for America, a nonprofit legal organization that combats hate and extremism, said the riot was a natural outcome of the violence and extremism promoted online.\n\n\"This is not a spontaneous event. This is the result of years of incitement and propaganda, from the White House on down, that has given permission and emboldened extremists,\" Spitalnick said. \"It's the logical outcome of a president who has spent four years attacking the very institutions that are the bedrock of our democracy.\"\n\nMembers of far-right groups, including the Proud Boys and white supremacist organizations, were identified among the rioters. Online forums used by Trump supporters celebrated the chaos at the Capitol. Figures and groups known for spreading conspiracy theories like QAnon were also present.\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, called the event \"a dark day for democracy.\" He urged social media platforms to take action against threats and calls for violence following the riot.\n\n\"The rioters who stormed the Capitol were fueled by hate, disinformation, and conspiracy theories,\" Greenblatt said. \"Social media platforms must take swift and decisive action to remove these threats and calls for violence from their platforms.\"\n\nOren Segal, vice president of the ADL's Center on Extremism, said the riot was the \"logical conclusion to extremism and hate going unchecked.\" He pointed to the surge in online mentions of the phrases \"civil war\" and \"storm the capitol\" in the days leading up to the event.\n\nPrior to the riot, Proud Boys leader Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio was arrested in Washington, D.C., and ordered to stay out of the city. Tarrio has a history of promoting violence and engaging in clashes with counter-protesters.\n\nIn response to the riot, the ADL's CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, called for the suspension of President Trump's social media accounts. Twitter partially enforced this call, temporarily suspending Trump's account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.\n\n\"The president's words matter. They have real-world consequences,\" Greenblatt said. \"It's time for Twitter and other social media platforms to take decisive action to protect our democracy and prevent further harm.\"\n\nThe events at the Capitol underscored the urgent need to address the growing threat of far-right extremism and disinformation in the United States, experts said.\n\n\"This is not a one-off event. This is a symptom of a much larger problem,\" Spitalnick said. \"We need to take this threat seriously and take action to combat it before it gets worse.\"\n\nThe riot at the Capitol was a stark reminder of the dangerous consequences of allowing hateful rhetoric and disinformation to go unchecked, experts warned. It was a dark day for democracy, they said, but it was not the end of the story.\n\n\"We cannot let this be the new normal,\" Greenblatt said. \"We must come together as a nation to address the root causes of this extremism and work to build a more inclusive, tolerant, and democratic society.\""}

The historic sentencing came almost three months after a jury found Chauvin guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nSarah Fitzgerald, a spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, confirmed that Chauvin will have to serve two-thirds of his sentence (15 years) before becoming eligible for supervised release. \"Mr. Chauvin will begin serving his sentence in a restricted housing unit for his safety,\" she stated.

Judge Peter Cahill highlighted several aggravating factors, including Chauvin's abuse of authority and particular cruelty towards Floyd.\n\n\"I'll tell you that you committed a serious felony crime,\" Judge Cahill told Chauvin during the sentencing hearing. \"The sentence that I'm imposing is not based on emotion or sympathy.

Trump is unfolding in the hallowed halls of the U.S. Senate, raising crucial political and legal questions that touch upon the very essence of our constitutional system. At the heart of the matter is the U.S. Constitution, which grants Congress the sole authority to impeach and remove a president for \"treason, high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\n\n\"The power of impeachment is a power given to Congress by the Constitution, and it is a power that is broad in scope,\" explained Jan Baran, a partner at Holtzman Vogel Josefiak and Torchinsky, and a practitioner before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nTrump was impeached for \"incitement of insurrection\" following the January 6 Capitol invasion by his political supporters. The articles of impeachment allege that Trump \"gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government.\"\n\nTrump's legal team, led by Bruce Castor and David Schoen, argue that his speech on the Ellipse on January 6 did not incite violence and is protected under the First Amendment. In their view, the President was merely exercising his constitutional right to free speech.\n\nDouglas Laycock, a Professor of Law at the University of Virginia, disagreed. \"The First Amendment does not protect speech that incites or advocates imminent lawless action,\" he stated.\n\nLegal experts largely agree that the Constitution permits the impeachment of a former official. \"The power to impeach does not expire with the end of a president's term,\" said Michael Dorf, a Professor of Law at Cornell Law School.\n\nHowever, the House managers and Trump's legal team disagree on the definition of incitement in an impeachment trial. The House managers argue that Trump's words incited the crowd at the Capitol, while Trump's lawyers argue for peaceful demonstration intentions.\n\nThe definition of incitement in an impeachment trial is broader than in criminal courts, allowing for a wider range of speech to be scrutinized. \"In criminal law, the government has to prove that the defendant's words were a 'direct and proximate cause' of the violent act,\" explained Baran. \"But in an impeachment trial, the House managers only need to demonstrate that the President's speech contributed to creating an atmosphere that led to the violent act.\"\n\nThe First Amendment's protection of free speech has nuanced applications in impeachment proceedings. \"The First Amendment is not an absolute bar to impeachment for speech,\" stated Dorf. \"The question is whether the speech rises to the level of 'high crimes and misdemeanors.'\"\n\nMore than 170 constitutional law scholars believe the impeachment of a former president is constitutional. In a letter to Senate leaders, they wrote, \"Presidents are not kings, and both during and after their tenure in office, they are subject to the Constitution.\"\n\nThe discussion surrounding First Amendment protections and incitement standards is key to Trump's impeachment defense. \"We will present a robust defense based on the Constitution and the facts,\" stated Trump's legal team in a statement. \"The First Amendment is at the heart of our case.\"\n\nAs the impeachment trial unfolds, the legal and constitutional issues at stake will be the subject of intense debate and scrutiny. The outcome of this trial will have far-reaching implications for the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches of government, as well as for the protection of free speech in the United States."}

The importance of this commission cannot be overstated, as we gather here to address the pressing issues facing women and girls around the world.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, esteemed delegates, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the pivotal role that the Commission on the Status of Women has played in advancing gender equality and women's empowerment. For more than seven decades, this esteemed body has been a beacon of hope, a catalyst for change, and a testament to the resilience and determination of women and girls worldwide.\n\nAs we gather here today, it is crucial to remember that democracy and gender equality are inextricably linked. Democracy, at its core, is about ensuring that every voice is heard, every vote is counted, and every citizen has an equal opportunity to contribute to the betterment of society. When we speak of democracy, we must also speak of gender equality, for the full participation of women is essential to the health and vitality of any democratic system.\n\nSadly, we find ourselves in a time when the very foundations of democracy are under threat. Over the past 15 years, we have witnessed a troubling decline in global freedom, with the past year marking the worst year on record for global democracy and freedom. This trend is not unique to any one region or country; it is a global phenomenon that demands our collective attention and action.\n\nIn light of the current global health and economic crises, it is more important than ever that we defend democracy and uphold the values that make it possible. The United States, under the leadership of President Joe Biden, is doing just that. We are strengthening our engagement with the United Nations and rejoining the Human Rights Council, sending a clear message that we are committed to working together to address the challenges facing the world today.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the status of democracy is fundamentally linked to the empowerment of women. When women are given the opportunity to participate fully in the political and economic spheres, democracies thrive. In the United States, we have seen this firsthand. Women have made history in recent elections, with record numbers serving in Congress and assuming leadership roles at all levels of government.\n\nHowever, we cannot rest on our laurels. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant threats to women's economic, physical security, and health worldwide. Women have been disproportionately affected by job losses, and the burden of caregiving responsibilities has fallen on their shoulders. In many parts of the world, women have been denied access to essential health services, putting them at greater risk of contracting the virus.\n\nTo address these challenges, the United States is re-engaging with the World Health Organization and revitalizing partnerships to empower women and girls around the world. We believe that by investing in the health, education, and economic empowerment of women, we can build stronger, more resilient communities and democracies.\n\nAs we look to the future, let us remember the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, who once said, \"It is not fair to ask of others what you are unwilling to do yourself.\" We must uphold the democratic values that have brought us this far and continue our efforts to improve the status of women and girls around the world. Together, we can make a difference.\n\nIn conclusion, the Commission on the Status of Women plays a vital role in advancing gender equality and women's empowerment, and I am proud to stand with you all in this endeavor. Let us remember that democracy and gender equality are inextricably linked, and that the full participation of women is essential to the health and vitality of any democratic system. Let us redouble our efforts to defend democracy and uphold the values that make it possible. And let us never forget that the future belongs to those who believe in the power of women and the potential of a world where every voice is heard and every citizen has an equal opportunity to contribute to the betterment of society.\n\nThank you."}

Tom Rice (R-S.C.) and Liz Cheney (R-Wy.), joined Democrats in voting to impeach President Donald Trump on charges of \"incitement of insurrection\" following the Capitol riot on January 6. This small but significant group represents a wide ideological spectrum within the Grand Old Party.\n\nRep. Tom Rice, a House Republican from South Carolina, acknowledged the political risk of his vote. \"The president of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our democratic process. I cannot in good conscience vote to shield him from consequence,\" Rice said in a statement.\n\nJim Jordan (R-Ohio), a staunch Trump ally, downplayed the significance of the impeachment vote. \"Impeaching a president with only days left in office is not only unconstitutional, but it's also a dangerous precedent,\" Jordan said in a statement.\n\nGarland \"Andy\" Barr (R-Ky.), another House Republican, argued that the GOP's hesitance to impeach was due to concerns over the impeachment process and the political climate. \"This rush to judgment based on an unproven allegation is inconsistent with due process and fundamental fairness,\" Barr stated.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has not yet made a final decision on the impeachment trial in the Senate but expressed openness to conviction. \"The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president and other powerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government,\" McConnell said in a statement.\n\nSeveral Senate Republicans, including Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), voiced concerns over Trump's role in the Capitol riot and his election fraud claims. Toomey stated, \"There's no question, none at all, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for Wednesday's violence.\" Sasse added, \"I'm prepared to support the conviction of the president.\"\n\nThe bipartisan nature of the impeachment vote could help gain traction in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is required for conviction. With a narrow Democratic majority in the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) signed the article of impeachment, sending it to the Senate for trial.\n\nThe division among Republicans reflects broader concerns about the party's future and Trump's role in shaping it. \"This is a pivotal moment for the Republican Party and our democracy,\" said Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist and founder of the anti-Trump group The Bulwark.\n\nOne of the impeachment managers, Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), expressed optimism about the prospects for conviction in the Senate. \"This isn't a partisan issue. It's an issue of accountability,\" Dean said.\n\nTrump's impeachment trial will be the third in U.S. history, following those of Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999. The Senate trial could begin as early as February, setting the stage for a dramatic political showdown."}

In a recent memo to employees, she wrote, \"We've all been through a lot these past few months, and I want to be clear: It's okay to take a break.\"\n\nThe cultural and structural changes at Citigroup are part of a strategic plan Fraser will unveil in March, marking her first full year as CEO. Fraser's goal is to attract and retain top talent in an increasingly competitive market. \"We need to be a place where people want to work,\" she said in a recent interview.\n\nHowever, Citigroup faces significant challenges. The bank has underperformed in stock value compared to its competitors and faces regulatory pressure to overhaul its risk management and data systems. In August 2020, Citigroup made headlines for a significant blunder when it erroneously wired nearly $1 billion due to a mistake, costing the bank over $500 million.\n\nMike Mayo, a longtime banking analyst, commented on Fraser's plans, \"Fraser's efforts to improve work-life balance and rebrand Citigroup are necessary, but insufficient without addressing deeper governance issues.\"\n\nFraser has a history of managing crisis situations effectively, having dealt with challenges both in Citigroup's mortgage business and its Latin America operations. In 2008, she led the bank's mortgage business through the financial crisis, and in 2014, she oversaw Citigroup's Latin America operations during political unrest in Venezuela.\n\nFraser's appointment as CEO raised questions about the 'glass cliff' phenomenon – the theory that women are more likely to be appointed to leadership positions during times of crisis or instability. Fraser acknowledged the issue in a recent interview, saying, \"I'm aware of the glass cliff phenomenon, but I don't see myself as a trailblazer. I see myself as the best person for the job.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Fraser remains optimistic about Citigroup's future. \"We have a lot of work to do, but I believe in the potential of this institution,\" she said in a recent interview. \"We have the people, the resources, and the vision to succeed.\"\n\nCritics argue that Fraser's efforts to improve work-life balance and rebrand Citigroup are just surface-level changes and that the bank needs to address deeper structural issues to remain competitive. However, Fraser remains committed to her vision. \"We're not just a bank,\" she said. \"We're a community of people dedicated to making a positive impact on the world.\"\n\nIn the coming months, Fraser will continue to implement her strategic plan, focusing on improving Citigroup's financial performance, modernizing its technology systems, and strengthening its risk management capabilities. She remains confident that she can lead Citigroup through these challenges and position it for long-term success.\n\nFraser also intends to introduce a 'hybrid' work model for the post-pandemic period, allowing staff to work up to two days from home per week. She believes that this model will not only improve work-life balance for employees but also increase productivity and reduce real estate costs. \"We've learned a lot during the pandemic about what works and what doesn't,\" she said. \"I believe that a hybrid work model is the way forward for our industry.\"\n\nFraser's approach to work-life balance and rebranding Citigroup as the 'bank with a soul' is a marked departure from the traditional Wall Street approach. However, some analysts argue that these changes are not enough to address the deeper structural issues facing the bank. As Fraser continues to implement her strategic plan and navigate the challenges facing Citigroup, she will undoubtedly face both criticism and support from investors, analysts, and the public.\n\nIn conclusion, Jane Fraser's appointment as Citigroup's CEO marks a new chapter in the bank's history. Her unconventional approach to work-life balance and rebranding Citigroup as the 'bank with a soul' is a bold move in an industry known for its long hours and grueling work schedules. However, Fraser faces significant challenges, including regulatory pressure, financial underperformance, and the need to address deeper structural issues. With her history of managing crisis situations effectively and her commitment to her vision, Fraser remains optimistic about Citigroup's future. As she continues to implement her strategic plan, she will undoubtedly face both criticism and support from investors, analysts, and the public.\n\nQuote from Jane Fraser: \"We have a lot of work to do, but I believe in the potential of this institution.

The legislation aims to fund apprenticeships, repair roads and bridges, and expand broadband access, among other projects.\n\nDuring her visit, Harris emphasized the significance of the new law for Ohioans. \"Ohio is going to receive $9.2 billion for highway programs and $483 million for bridge repairs over the next five years,\" she said. \"This is going to put people to work, create good-paying jobs, and make our roads and bridges safer and more efficient.\"\n\nSecretary of Labor Marty Walsh accompanied Harris on her tour, discussing the impact of the law on workforce development. \"The infrastructure bill is going to create 1.5 million jobs over the next ten years,\" Walsh stated. \"These are not just any jobs; they are good-paying jobs with benefits.\"\n\nBob Paduchik, Ohio Republican Party chairman, criticized Harris' visit as a distraction from pressing issues. \"With our border crisis at an all-time high, the Vice President comes to Ohio to talk about infrastructure?\" Paduchik stated. \"The American people deserve better than this political theater.\"\n\nHarris responded, \"Our administration is addressing the border crisis, and we are working closely with our partners in Mexico and Central America to create safe and orderly migration. At the same time, we are investing in our infrastructure to lower living costs for families, improve the economy, and create good-paying jobs.\"\n\nHarris also touched upon criminal justice reform during her speech, expressing disappointment in the not guilty verdict for Kyle Rittenhouse. \"Justice must be served, and we need criminal justice reform to ensure that it is,\" she said. \"We cannot allow the cycle of violence to continue.\"\n\nThe Vice President's visit highlighted key Biden administration priorities amid ongoing policy debates. Ohio is set to receive an additional $100 million for expanding broadband access. Substantial funds are allocated for airports, public transportation, and water projects.\n\nThe visit came after the passing of a $2 trillion spending bill for social services and climate initiatives. Harris briefly served as acting president while Biden underwent a colonoscopy on Oct. 22, 2021.\n\nAddressing the economy, Harris argued, \"We need to address the supply chain issues to get our economy moving again. Our infrastructure bill is a crucial step in that direction.\"\n\nHarris' visit marked a significant moment in Columbus' political landscape, underscoring the Biden administration's dedication to improving infrastructure and creating jobs. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is expected to have a profound impact on Ohio and the nation as a whole."}

The tech giant's ongoing efforts to address disinformation intensified after the 2016 Russian election interference.\n\nThe company has targeted hundreds of takedowns involving diverse groups, from political organizations to disinformation-for-hire firms. However, critics, including a Facebook whistleblower, accuse the social media giant of neglecting domestic disinformation campaigns, particularly in strategically important countries.\n\nFacebook's practices relating to the handling of disinformation were recently highlighted in the 'Facebook Papers,' revealing a contrast with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's public statements. The documents showed that Facebook was aware of the negative impact of its platform on young users, yet continued to prioritize growth over user safety.\n\nOne of the China-related operations involved a fake account of a Swiss biologist claiming U.S. pressure on WHO scientists. This disinformation was amplified by Chinese state-controlled media, showcasing the intricate nature of foreign influence campaigns on social media.\n\nFacebook also linked some disinformation efforts about the Belarus-Poland border crisis to the Belarusian KGB, aiming to criticize Poland's treatment of migrants. In Gaza, a Hamas-led disinformation campaign was aimed at garnering support for Hamas while criticizing Israel and its political rivals.\n\nAs adversarial groups continue to evolve their tactics, Facebook is striving to adapt. The company cited crackdowns on anti-vaccination harassment campaigns in Europe as examples of their success in combating disinformation. However, critics argue that more needs to be done, particularly in addressing the root causes of disinformation.\n\nThe report underscores the global scale of the disinformation issue and Facebook's central role in shaping public discourse. With over 2.8 billion monthly active users, the platform provides a fertile ground for malicious actors to spread false information and manipulate public opinion.\n\nThe removal of these disinformation networks is a step in the right direction, but it highlights the need for increased transparency and accountability from social media companies. Facebook must continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of its users over growth and profits.\n\nThe battle against disinformation is a complex one, and Facebook's efforts are just one piece of the puzzle. Governments, civil society organizations, and individuals must also play their part in combating the spread of false information and promoting digital literacy. Only through a collective effort can we hope to mitigate the negative impact of disinformation on our societies and democracies."}

According to data from social media analytics firm Zignal Labs, Trump's mentions on social media have decreased by an astounding 91%.\n\nThe events of January 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn the election results, led to the permanent suspension of Trump's accounts on the two largest social media platforms. Both Twitter and Facebook cited the risk of further incitement of violence as their reason for the ban.\n\nIn a statement following the suspension, Facebook's Oversight Board upheld the decision, citing Trump's repeated violation of the companies' rules and his role in inciting the Capitol riot.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his criticism of the bans, calling them a \"disgrace\" and an \"embarrassment to the country.\" In an interview with Fox News, he argued that social media companies should pay a political price for their actions.\n\nDespite the ban, Trump has found new ways to communicate with his followers. He recently launched a personal blog, \"From the Desk of Donald J. Trump,\" where he shares updates and messages with his subscribers.\n\nTrump adviser Jason Miller hinted at the former president's plans to return to social media in a more significant way. In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Miller said, \"President Trump is a master of communication, and he will continue to shock the world.\"\n\nMiller went on to suggest that Trump's return to social media would involve the creation of his own platform, aiming to \"redefine the game.\"\n\nBefore the ban, Trump had relied heavily on email communications to keep in touch with his supporters. In a statement to The New York Times, a Trump adviser described the email list as \"the most valuable piece of digital property in politics.\"\n\nThe decline in Trump's social media presence has had a significant impact on his ability to reach and engage with his supporters. While his blog has gained some traction, it remains to be seen whether it can match the reach and engagement of his social media accounts.\n\nDespite the challenges, Trump's team remains committed to finding new ways to communicate with his followers.

Tanker Trackers reports that tankers carrying oil from Saudi Arabia, Russia, Oman, and the US are among those affected.\n\nThe Suez Canal accounts for about 30% of global container ship traffic each day, with nearly 19,000 ships passing through in 2020. Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company, says seven of its vessels have been affected by the blockage.\n\nRe-floating the Ever Given is technically complicated and could take days, according to a senior canal pilot at the Suez Canal Authority. Rabie suggested that the ship is likely to be towed to the nearest parking site for offloading and minor repairs.\n\nThe disruption may impact oil and gas flows depending on the duration it takes to clear the container ship, with industry sources suggesting it could be resolved in days rather than weeks.\n\n\"The situation is serious, but under control,\" Rabie told CNN. \"We are working to refloat the ship as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe container ship Ever Given ran aground in the Suez Canal on Tuesday, causing a significant traffic jam in one of the world's busiest waterways. (CNN)\n\nThe Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, is a vital shipping lane for global trade. More than one million barrels of oil and petroleum products pass through the canal every day, according to data from the Suez Canal Authority.\n\nThe disruption could have far-reaching economic consequences, particularly for countries in Europe and Asia, which rely on Middle Eastern oil and natural gas imports.\n\n\"The Suez Canal is a critical artery for global trade, particularly for energy supplies,\" said Simon Henderson, the director of the Gulf and Energy Policy Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \"A prolonged disruption could have serious economic consequences for countries in Europe and Asia that rely on Middle Eastern oil and natural gas imports.\"\n\nThe Ever Given's grounding in the Suez Canal comes at a time when global supply chains are already under strain due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The blockage could exacerbate delays and disruptions, leading to higher prices for consumer goods and raw materials.\n\nThe Suez Canal Authority said that it was working to clear the backlog of vessels as quickly as possible. The authority has opened the parallel western branch of the canal to allow traffic to flow in both directions, but it is not wide enough to accommodate the largest container ships.\n\nThe grounding of the Ever Given is the latest in a series of incidents that have disrupted shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden in recent years. In 2015, a Saudi-flagged oil tanker, the Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) Saudi, ran aground off the Yemeni coast, blocking the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. The incident caused a temporary surge in oil prices and disrupted global oil flows.\n\nThe Suez Canal Authority said that it was working to clear the backlog of vessels as quickly as possible. (CNN)\n\nThe grounding of the Ever Given is also a reminder of the vulnerability of global shipping lanes to weather and environmental conditions. In 2009, a container ship, the MV Maersk Alabama, was hijacked by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden, sparking a major international response.\n\nThe grounding of the Ever Given in the Suez Canal is a reminder of the vital role that the canal plays in global trade and the importance of ensuring its safety and security. It is also a reminder of the challenges and risks that come with relying on complex and interconnected global supply chains.\n\n\"The Suez Canal is a critical infrastructure asset for the global economy, and its safe and efficient operation is essential for maintaining the flow of goods and energy supplies,\" said Henderson. \"This incident underscores the importance of investing in the resilience and security of global shipping lanes and infrastructure.\"\n\nThe Ever Given's grounding in the Suez Canal is a reminder of the vital role that the canal plays in global trade and the importance of ensuring its safety and security. (CNN)\n\nIn conclusion, the grounding of the Ever Given in the Suez Canal has caused a significant disruption to global trade and could have far-reaching economic consequences, particularly for countries in Europe and Asia that rely on Middle Eastern oil and natural gas imports. The incident is a reminder of the vulnerability of global shipping lanes to weather and environmental conditions and the importance of investing in their resilience and security. The Suez Canal Authority is working to clear the backlog of vessels as quickly as possible, but the duration of the disruption remains uncertain."}

I want to speak directly to you all about where we are now, the challenges we face, and the reasons for hope as we approach the holiday season.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to acknowledge the fatigue and frustration that many of you have felt during this pandemic, especially as we enter the holiday season. I understand that it's been a long and difficult journey for all of us. The uncertainty, the loss, the isolation - it has taken a toll on us all. But today, I want to remind you that we are not where we were when this crisis began.\n\nIn March 2020, we were in the dark. We knew very little about this virus and how it spread. We had no vaccines, no treatments, and limited medical supplies. But today, we have over 200 million fully vaccinated Americans. We have effective vaccines and boosters for all eligible individuals. We have the knowledge and the tools to protect ourselves and our loved ones.\n\nI cannot stress enough the importance of getting vaccinated and boosted. The data is clear: the risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 is significantly higher for unvaccinated individuals compared to those who are vaccinated and boosted. Vaccines have been proven to save lives and reduce the severity of illness for those who do contract the virus.\n\nNow, I know that even fully vaccinated people might contract the Omicron variant. But the evidence suggests that they are likely to experience mild symptoms, if any at all. This is why it's crucial that we all take additional precautions to protect ourselves and our communities. I urge you all to wear masks indoors in public settings, especially in areas with high transmission rates.\n\nBut let me assure you, vaccinated Americans: you can safely celebrate the holidays with your family and friends. The data shows that the risk of transmission is significantly lower among vaccinated individuals. So, let us gather together in joy and gratitude, knowing that we have the power to protect ourselves and our loved ones from this virus.\n\nI also want to acknowledge the significant increase in vaccinated Americans since July. This is a testament to the resilience and determination of the American people. I urge the unvaccinated among us to fulfill your patriotic duty by getting the vaccine. It's not just about protecting yourself; it's about protecting your loved ones, your community, and our nation as a whole.\n\nNow, I want to address the current situation and the efforts we are making to increase vaccination and booster availability. I've ordered FEMA to support vaccination efforts, and we are adding 10,000 new vaccination sites across the country. We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that every American who wants a vaccine can get one.\n\nBut let me be clear: this is not a return to March 2020. We are not in the same position we were then. We have the knowledge, the tools, and the resources to fight this virus. We will get through this together.\n\nSo, my fellow Americans, as we enter this holiday season, let us remember the progress we've made and the reasons for hope. Let us continue to protect ourselves and our loved ones by getting vaccinated and boosted. Let us come together in joy and unity, knowing that we have the power to overcome this crisis. And let us remain steadfast in our commitment to each other and to our nation.\n\nIn closing, I want to express my deepest gratitude to all the frontline workers, healthcare professionals, scientists, and volunteers who have worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic to keep us safe and informed. Your dedication and sacrifices have not gone unnoticed. And to all the Americans who have persevered through this difficult time, I want to say: we are in this together, and we will get through it together.\n\nGod bless you all, and God bless the United States of America."}

The accidental transfer totaled almost $900 million.\n\nBenjamin Finestone, a lawyer representing two of the lenders, Brigade and HPS Investment Partners, stated, \"Our clients believed they had received an intentional prepayment of their loans by Citibank, based on the amounts owed to them.\"\n\nThe erroneous transfer included $175 million to a hedge fund and a total of $500 million is still unrecovered from ten investment advisory firms. Revlon's lenders were initially unaware of the mistake and believed the funds were a prepayment of their loans.\n\nUnder New York law, the \"discharge-for-value-defense\" allows beneficiaries to keep money if they are entitled to it and unaware that it was sent accidentally. The judge found that the lenders' belief that the payment was intentional was justified, citing Citibank's sophistication as making a mistake seem improbable.\n\nInternal chats from HPS employees joking about the mistake were used as evidence that they were unaware the wiring was a mistake. Finestone commented, \"Our clients acted in good faith based on the information they had at the time.\"\n\nA temporary restraining order has been issued, preventing the lenders from utilizing the funds due to the potential for an appeal. Citigroup strongly disagrees with the decision and intends to appeal, aiming to recover the full amount transferred.\n\nCitibank issued a statement saying, \"We continue to believe that we are entitled to recover the erroneously paid funds and will appeal the court's decision.\"\n\nThe pandemic has taken a toll on makeup brands such as Revlon, with its shares trading over 40% lower than a year ago. Revlon's financial struggles could complicate Citibank's efforts to recover the funds.\n\nFinestone commented on the impact of the pandemic on the case, \"The economic conditions in the industry make it more challenging for our clients to return the funds, but they remain committed to doing so if and when Citibank prevails on appeal.\"\n\nThe accidental transfer was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on March 25, 2021.\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Citibank said, \"We are disappointed in the court's ruling and believe we are entitled to recover the erroneously paid funds. We will appeal the decision and continue to work with the affected parties to resolve this matter as efficiently as possible.\"\n\nThe judge's ruling could set a precedent for similar cases in the future, potentially impacting the banking industry.\n\nBenjamin Finestone weighed in on the potential implications of the case, \"This ruling could have far-reaching consequences for the banking industry and could impact the way that banks process payments in the future.\"\n\nCitibank's mistake is not an isolated incident. In 2014, JPMorgan Chase accidentally wired $300 million to a hedge fund instead of $3 million in interest payments. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.\n\nA source close to the situation commented on the similarities between the cases, \"These types of mistakes happen more often than people realize. The key is how they are handled and whether the parties involved are willing to work together to resolve the issue.\"\n\nAs the case unfolds, Citibank and the lenders will face a lengthy legal battle to determine who is entitled to the funds. The outcome could have significant implications for the banking industry and the way that payments are processed in the future.\n\nFinestone concluded, \"This case highlights the importance of clear communication and due diligence in the financial industry.

Hutchinson was named the game's most valuable player, finishing with six tackles, three tackles for loss, and two sacks.\n\nMyre's legacy lived on through the game, with the Michigan community coming together to support each other in the wake of the tragic shooting. \"It's been a tough few weeks for our community, but today was a reminder of the power of coming together and supporting each other,\" Harbaugh said. \"We're just grateful to be a part of something bigger than football, and we'll continue to honor Tate's memory in everything we do.\"\n\nAs Michigan celebrates its Big Ten championship win and College Football Playoff berth, the team remains focused on honoring the legacy of Tate Myre and the Oxford community. \"We know there's still work to be done, both on and off the field,\" Hutchinson said. \"But we're up for the challenge, and we'll continue to play for Tate and the Oxford community every step of the way.\""}

The campaign, which utilized various social media channels and messages to exert \"maximum pressure\" on Iran's clerics, saw significant growth under the Trump administration.\n\nAccording to Gabriel Noronha, former manager of the State Department's Farsi social media channels, the number of followers on the department's Farsi-language Instagram account increased from 147,000 in January 2019 to a staggering 759,000 in January 2021. Noronha, who managed the account from 2018 to 2020, spoke to VOA News about the campaign's strategy and impact.\n\nThe Trump administration's social media strategy built upon efforts started under the Obama administration, which saw the use of social media as a tool to engage with Iranians and challenge the regime's narrative. However, the Trump administration's approach was more aggressive and often dismissed or mocked by Iranians.\n\nAbbas Mousavi, then-Foreign Ministry spokesman for Iran, responded negatively to Trump's tweets in support of Iranian protests, criticizing the use of the Persian language in them. \"The U.S. administration's attempts to interfere in Iran's internal affairs through social media are doomed to failure,\" Mousavi said in a statement.\n\nThe most engaging posts on the State Department's Farsi Instagram account supported calls for anti-government protests and celebrated pre-Islamic Revolution Iranian cultural traditions. Nazenin Ansari, managing editor of Kayhan London and Kayhan Life, noted that these posts resonated with many Iranians, particularly the younger generation.\n\nTrump's Farsi tweets, particularly in support of Iranian protests, drew significant attention and likes. Holly Dagres, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, pointed out that these tweets helped amplify the voices of Iranian activists and increased international awareness of human rights abuses in Iran.\n\nAlireza Nader, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, warned that the Biden administration's shift in approach might overlook human rights abuses in Iran. \"The Biden administration should continue to use social media as a tool to engage with Iranians, but it should also prioritize diplomacy and human rights,\" Nader said.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's social media strategy, Instagram remains a popular platform in Iran, with an estimated 42 million users. Instagram is accessible in Iran, while Facebook and Twitter are blocked but can be accessed via virtual private networks (VPNs).\n\nThe use of social media as a tool to engage with Iranians and challenge the regime's narrative is not new. However, the Trump administration's aggressive approach drew significant attention and sparked debate about the effectiveness and ethics of this strategy.\n\nAs the Biden administration takes office, it remains to be seen how it will approach Iran's social media landscape. Some observers argue that a more diplomatic and nuanced approach is needed, while others maintain that social media should continue to be used as a tool to amplify the voices of Iranian activists and challenge the regime's narrative. Regardless of the approach, one thing is clear: social media will continue to play a significant role in shaping the narrative around Iran both domestically and internationally."}

The bill, which mirrors the structure of the 9/11 Commission, now moves to the Senate for consideration.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said, \"This bipartisan commission will help ensure that such an attack cannot and will not ever happen again.\" House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) both opposed the commission, but Hoyer mentioned that McCarthy received his requested compromises on the commission's structure.\n\nMcConnell, however, dismissed the need for the commission, endorsing existing Congressional investigations instead. \"The Senate's already engaged in extensive oversight of that day's events,\" McConnell stated. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) expressed optimism about the bill's prospects in the upper chamber.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) suggested the possibility of conducting regular committee hearings if the Senate blocks the commission.

Bill Cassidy 'At Peace' With Trump Impeachment Vote, Despite Backlash\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) – U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) expressed a sense of calm and resolution following his vote to convict former President Donald Trump during the impeachment trial, despite facing criticism and censure from the Louisiana Republican Party and Trump supporters.\n\nCassidy was one of seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. The 57-43 Senate vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict Trump, but Cassidy stood by his decision to uphold his oath to support and defend the Constitution.\n\nThe Louisiana senator faced backlash for his vote from the state's Republican Party, which censured him for his actions. However, Cassidy believes this does not represent the broader opinion of the party, as he has received support and respect from some Republicans for his decision.\n\nCassidy's vote diverged from that of Louisiana's other U.S. senator, John Kennedy, who voted against conviction. Kennedy argued that impeaching a former president was unprecedented and not within Congress's jurisdiction.\n\nDespite the post-impeachment backlash, Cassidy has sought to focus on other issues, including Biden's cabinet confirmations and weather recovery efforts in Louisiana. However, Trump supporters have continued to criticize Cassidy, leading to calls for his exclusion from Republican events and more local GOP groups condemning his vote.\n\nSome Republicans who acquitted Trump disputed the evidence presented during the trial, while others questioned the constitutionality of impeaching a former president. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), for example, argued that a former president could not be impeached because they no longer held office and therefore could not commit new offenses.\n\nCassidy, however, argued that the impeachment trial was not about punishing Trump but about upholding the Constitution and preventing future presidents from inciting violence. In a statement following the vote, he said, \"The Constitution grants Congress the power to impeach and remove officeholders who commit high crimes and misdemeanors. I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and that is what I did today.\"\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding his vote, Cassidy remains optimistic about the future of the Republican Party and his political career. He believes that the party can move forward and focus on issues important to the American people, such as economic recovery and national security.\n\nHowever, the aftermath of the impeachment trial has highlighted the deep divisions within the Republican Party, with some members continuing to support Trump and others prioritizing the Constitution above party loyalty. As the debate over Trump's role in American politics continues, Cassidy and other Republicans will face difficult choices about where their loyalties lie.\n\nIn the meantime, Cassidy remains committed to representing the people of Louisiana and upholding the principles of the Constitution, regardless of the political consequences."}

SOFREP, a military and defense news outlet, has criticized initial reports, emphasizing a lack of firearm safety and terminology accuracy. The incident underscores the need for stricter safety protocols when dealing with actual firearms used as \"prop guns\" in movie productions.\n\nThe use of real firearms as props is a long-standing tradition in Hollywood. However, it's time to reconsider this practice given the potential risks involved. Instead, productions should invest in replicas or CGI firearms to minimize the chances of accidents. Stricter safety protocols, such as mandatory background checks and regular inspections of firearms, are essential to prevent future tragedies.\n\nThe lack of special training or licenses for the film's head armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, contrasts sharply with animal safety measures on movie sets. Arming professionals with the necessary knowledge and certifications could significantly reduce the risk of accidents. The NRA's role in firearms safety training, including for police and concealed carry permits, is a testament to the organization's expertise in this area.\n\nHollywood's close relationship with the firearms industry is no secret. Firearms are prominently featured and glorified in movies, often portrayed as symbols of power and masculinity. However, this relationship should not come at the expense of safety. It's high time for Hollywood to hold itself accountable and set an example for responsible firearm handling.\n\nOver the years, there has been an alarming increase in gun violence and the variety of firearms shown in movies. These depictions can desensitize audiences and contribute to a culture that normalizes and even romanticizes gun violence. As entertainment giants, Hollywood studios have a responsibility to promote a more nuanced and realistic portrayal of firearms.\n\nHollywood's hypocrisy on gun control is not lost on the public. Alec Baldwin, an outspoken critic of the NRA, has been involved in a tragic on-set shooting incident where a real firearm was used. The entertainment industry's reliance on firearms for entertainment while advocating for stricter gun laws creates a dissonance that rings hollow. Requiring armorers to be NRA Certified Range Safety Officers could help bridge this gap and ensure firearms safety on sets.\n\nStricter state requirements and special liability insurance for those handling firearms in film productions are necessary steps to mitigate risks. Hollywood should adopt serious safety standards similar to those for animal safety, prioritizing the well-being of cast and crew members. Only then can we ensure that the magic of movie-making doesn't come at the expense of human lives."}

A recent discovery on the couple's YouTube channel has caught the attention of social media users, with some claiming that Laundrie was seen reading Jeff VanderMeer's novel \"Annihilation\" in a video uploaded on August 19.\n\nThe novel, published in 2014, tells the story of four women who enter a mysterious area known as the Area X. Three of the women disappear, leaving the fourth one behind. The story explores themes of loss, identity, and the consequences of humanity's interaction with the natural world.\n\nAlyssa Rose, a TikTok user, was one of the first to bring attention to the video. She called it \"disturbing\" and suggested that it should be investigated by the police in light of Petito's disappearance. \"It's odd that Brian was reading a book about missing women in the woods right before Gabby went missing,\" she said in her TikTok video.\n\nHowever, not all TikTok users are convinced of the connection between the book and the Gabby Petito case. Some believe it's a far-fetched theory and that Laundrie could have been reading the book for any number of reasons. \"Maybe he just liked the book, or maybe he was researching for a project,\" one user commented on Rose's video.\n\nThe \"Nomadik Statik\" YouTube channel, where the video was uploaded, has since been made private. However, screenshots of the video have been circulating on social media, showing Laundrie sitting in a car with a copy of \"Annihilation\" in his hands.\n\nThe novel gained renewed attention in 2018 when a movie adaptation was released, starring Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The movie follows a similar plot to the book, with a biologist (played by Portman) investigating the disappearance of a team of researchers in the Area X.\n\nMeanwhile, the search for Petito came to a tragic end on Sunday, September 19, when the FBI announced the discovery of a body at Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming. Teton County Coroner Dr. Brent Blue confirmed that the body was that of Gabby Petito.\n\nThe discovery of Petito's body was described as \"heartbreaking\" by Laundrie family's attorney, Steven Bertolino. \"This is not the outcome anyone was hoping for,\" he said in a statement. \"It is important to remember that Gabby was a person with hopes and dreams for the future.\"\n\nPetito went missing last month during a trip with Laundrie, who returned home to North Port, Florida, on September 1 without her. Laundrie subsequently disappeared, prompting a nationwide manhunt.\n\nThe discovery of Petito's body came just days after her family issued a plea for information about her whereabouts. \"We will never give up hope that she will be found safe,\" the Petito family said in a statement. \"Our hearts are shattered and we are devastated for Gabby's loss.\"\n\nThe investigation into Petito's disappearance and Laundrie's role in it continues. Authorities are currently searching for Laundrie in the Carlton Reserve in Sarasota County, Florida.\n\nMeanwhile, social media users continue to discuss the \"Annihilation\" video and its potential significance to the case. Some are calling for a more thorough investigation of Laundrie's actions leading up to Petito's disappearance.\n\nHowever, others caution against jumping to conclusions based on circumstantial evidence. \"It's important to remember that reading a book about missing women doesn't make someone a killer,\" one user commented on Rose's TikTok video.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the \"Annihilation\" video, some social media users are using it as a way to remember Petito and raise awareness about missing persons cases. \"Gabby may be gone, but her memory lives on,\" one user wrote on Twitter.\n\nAs the investigation into Petito's disappearance and Laundrie's role in it continues, many are calling for transparency and accountability. \"We deserve answers,\" one user wrote on Twitter. \"Gabby's life mattered, and so does the truth.\"\n\nThe Gabby Petito case has captured the attention of the nation, and the search for answers continues. As the investigation unfolds, it's important to remember that behind the headlines and social media speculation, there is a real person whose life was cut short far too soon. \"Rest in peace, Gabby,\" one user wrote on Twitter. \"Your story will not be forgotten.\"\n\nQuote from Alyssa Rose: \"It's odd that Brian was reading a book about missing women in the woods right before Gabby went missing.\"\n\nQuote from Dr. Brent Blue: \"The body was that of Gabby Petito.\""}

The saving rate jumped to 27.6%, the highest since 1981.\n\nThe labor market also showed signs of improvement, with labor costs surging by the most in 14 years in the first quarter, according to the Employment Cost Index released by the Labor Department on Thursday.\n\nSarah House, Senior Economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina, said the surge in labor costs was a sign of increased wage growth and potential labor market tightness.\n\n\"The labor market is starting to tighten up, which is putting upward pressure on wages,\" House said. \"Companies are having to pay more to attract and retain workers.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell echoed those sentiments, saying during a news conference on Wednesday that wage growth was expected to continue.\n\n\"We've seen some quite strong wage growth in the most recent data,\" Powell said. \"I think that's going to continue for a while, as long as the labor market remains tight.\"\n\nThe U.S. economy received a significant fiscal stimulus of $1.9 trillion from the White House in March, which economists expect will further accelerate consumer spending in the second quarter.\n\nThe government's expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination program and fiscal generosity are also lifting consumer spirits. A survey by the University of Michigan released on Friday showed consumer sentiment hitting its highest level since the pandemic began.\n\nHowever, the economic recovery is not without risks. Inflation is warming up, with the core PCE price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, increasing 1.8% in the 12 months through March.\n\nEconomists expect robust consumer spending and economic growth, with projections for growth of at least 7% in 2021. But they also warn of potential risks, including the possibility of inflation getting out of hand and the Delta variant of the virus threatening the economic recovery.\n\n\"There are definitely some risks on the horizon, but overall, we're optimistic about the economic outlook,\" House said.\n\nCoughlin agreed, but urged caution.\n\n\"It's important to remember that this recovery is not going to be smooth sailing,\" Coughlin said. \"There are going to be bumps in the road, and it's important for consumers and businesses to be prepared.\"\n\nDespite the risks, economists are generally optimistic about the economic outlook, with many predicting a strong rebound in the second half of the year.\n\n\"The economic recovery is gaining momentum, and we expect that to continue,\" House said. \"But it's important for policymakers to stay the course and provide the necessary support to keep the recovery on track.\""}

The data reveals these towns issue an alarming number of speeding tickets, relying heavily on this revenue source.\n\nThe Houston Chronicle analyzed traffic stop data from over 2,500 police departments in Texas to identify the top 21 towns for traffic stops in 2020. The analysis showed that these towns had more than 500 stops per officer.\n\nFour Central Texas towns made it to the top 11 list, with Bruceville-Eddy in 11th place and Buckholts in 10th. The data showed Bruceville-Eddy had 684 stops per officer and issued 1,336 citations in 2020. Buckholts had 741 stops per officer and issued 1,341 citations.\n\nIn second place was the town of Lott, which had a staggering 1,192 stops per officer and issued 2,475 citations. The top spot was taken by the town of Rosebud, with 1,385 stops per officer but only 1,001 citations issued in 2020.\n\nThe Houston Chronicle's investigation sheds light on the significant reliance of these small towns on speeding tickets as a revenue source. The data shows that these towns issue an inordinate number of citations, leading some to question the fairness and necessity of their aggressive enforcement.\n\nBruceville-Eddy, a town of just over 500 residents, saw its police department issue over 8,000 citations in 2020. The town's revenue from these citations amounts to over $800,000, which is a substantial portion of its budget.\n\nBuckholts, with a population of around 1,200, issued over 7,000 citations in 2020, generating around $700,000 in revenue. These numbers highlight the significant financial impact of speeding tickets on these small towns.\n\nCritics argue that these towns' aggressive enforcement tactics are unjust, as they disproportionately target low-income and minority drivers. The high volume of citations issued also raises concerns about the effectiveness of law enforcement in these communities.\n\nThe use of technology, such as driving apps like Waze, can help drivers avoid potential speed traps and stay within the speed limit. These apps alert drivers when they are over the speed limit, potentially helping them avoid costly citations and ensuring safer roads for all.\n\nAs the debate continues over the fairness and necessity of aggressive speed traps in small Texas towns, it is essential to consider the potential consequences for drivers and the communities affected. The use of technology, increased public awareness, and a focus on equitable enforcement can help mitigate the negative impacts of relying too heavily on speeding tickets as a revenue source."}

According to a new Harris Poll, 61% of Americans agreed with the ban due to the risks of further violence incitement, while 39% opposed it.\n\nJohn Gerzema, CEO of The Harris Poll, commented on the situation, stating, \"The American public is looking to corporate America and business leaders for guidance and leadership in the absence of political action.\" The poll also revealed that 36% of Republicans support the ban, compared to 80% of Democrats and 59% of independents.\n\nSocial media giant Facebook also banned Trump at least until after President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, with the possibility of an indefinite ban. The decision came after Trump's repeated posts that were deemed to incite violence. Gerzema added, \"The business community must navigate a fine line between protecting free speech and maintaining public safety.\"\n\nOpinions on the ban are not only split along partisan lines but also raise concerns about censorship. Thirty-six percent of Americans are concerned about censorship, but 69% agree that social media platforms can remove dangerous users. Forty percent of respondents felt that Trump should have been banned earlier, labeling the action \"too little, too late.\"\n\nThe poll results also showed that 37% of Americans felt embarrassed by Trump's ban from Twitter, while 58% agreed that removing him was the correct decision due to his dangerous actions. A Morning Consult poll found that half of Americans believe social media should have banned Trump earlier, with partisan differences in opinion on the bans.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham criticized the decision, stating, \"Twitter's actions yesterday to silence President Trump should deeply trouble all Americans who value free speech and the First Amendment.\" On the other hand, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi applauded the move, saying, \"President Trump's dangerous and seditious acts threatened the safety, security, and integrity of our democratic institutions. Social media companies made the right decision.\"\n\nThe Harris Poll also revealed that 42% of Americans fear the ban sets a censorship precedent, while 58% disagree. Gerzema emphasized, \"The business community must tread carefully, as their decisions have far-reaching implications for democracy and free speech.\"\n\nIn the midst of this partisan divide, one thing is clear: the role of corporate America and social media platforms in shaping public discourse and enforcing community standards has never been more crucial."}

Permanent shifts in work patterns, accelerated automation, and a transition to a different economy are reshaping industries and necessitating career changes and retraining for many.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell acknowledged this new reality during an interview with CNBC, stating, \"It's clear that a significant portion of the work that's lost in this downturn is not coming back.\"\n\nSusan Lund, Head of the McKinsey Global Institute, echoed Powell's sentiments, emphasizing the need for individuals to adapt. \"The labor market will never look the same. Workers will need to be more flexible and adaptable than ever before,\" she said.\n\nAccording to a recent survey by the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, more than 40% of the unemployed are considering changing their occupations or fields of work. Brad Hershbein, a Senior Economist at the institute, explained, \"People are recognizing that the job market is changing, and they need to change with it.\"\n\nHowever, financial resources for retraining pose a significant challenge for many. Bill Gates, the founder-turned-philanthropist of Microsoft, emphasized the importance of addressing this issue. \"We need to invest in education and training programs to help workers adapt,\" he said.\n\nAutomation is accelerating in industries such as retail and manufacturing, potentially reducing the need for human labor. Sumit Singh, CEO of online pet supply company Chewy, recently opened a fully automated fulfillment center requiring far fewer workers. Diane Pelkey, Chewy's spokeswoman, stated, \"This is just the beginning of the automation wave in our industry.\"\n\nJob postings indicate a decline in demand for various occupations, suggesting a shift in the job market. David Autor, an Economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, explained, \"We're seeing a clear trend toward automation in many industries, and it's important for workers to be aware of this and prepare accordingly.\"\n\nHowever, the unpredictability of which industries will thrive makes job transitions difficult. Stephanie Wissink, Managing Director at Jefferies, noted, \"It's a challenging time for workers. Some sectors are experiencing growth, but it's hard to know which ones will continue to thrive.\"\n\nDespite these challenges, initiatives like Michigan's 'Futures for Frontliners' program offer free tuition for retraining to front-line workers.

The decision comes on the heels of a record-breaking year for the canal, with increased competition from alternative maritime routes.\n\nAdmiral Osama Rabea, Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, stated, \"Despite the current global economic conditions and intense competition, we believe it is essential to maintain a balanced approach and continue investing in the Suez Canal's infrastructure and services.\"\n\nThe toll increase follows a successful year for the Suez Canal, which handled a record 1,847 transits in October 2021, marking a 12 percent increase in revenues compared to the same month in 2020. During the first ten months of 2021, the canal saw a nearly nine percent increase in tonnage, totaling approximately 1.2 billion metric tons.\n\nDespite the toll increase, Admiral Rabea emphasized that LNG carriers and cruise ships would be exempt from the new rates. The Chairman explained, \"We are committed to supporting these vital sectors, which contribute significantly to the global economy and the Suez Canal's success.\"\n\nThe rate for LNG carriers will be modified from 25 percent to 15 percent, reflecting the canal's ongoing commitment to fostering growth in the energy sector. Rabea added, \"LNG carriers are essential to the global energy market, and we are dedicated to providing them with efficient and cost-effective transit services.\"\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the cruise ship industry, resulting in a significant decline in traffic. In response, the Suez Canal Authority is making efforts to support the restoration of cruise ship traffic. Rabea shared, \"We understand the challenges faced by the cruise ship sector and are committed to working closely with industry stakeholders to help them recover.\"\n\nOn September 29, 2021, the Suez Canal set a new daily record for transits, with 87 vessels passing through the waterway. The record-breaking day underscores the importance of the Suez Canal as a critical trade artery connecting Asia, Europe, and Africa.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the pandemic and increased competition, the Suez Canal Authority remains focused on upgrading its operations to enhance service and prepare for continued strong volumes. Rabea declared, \"We are committed to maintaining the Suez Canal's position as the most efficient and reliable maritime trade route in the world.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the Suez Canal Authority's decision to increase toll rates for most vessels comes as the canal experiences record traffic and global economic uncertainties. By exempting LNG carriers and supporting the recovery of the cruise ship industry, the SCA aims to maintain its position as a vital hub for international trade while adapting to the evolving maritime landscape.\n\nAdmiral Osama Rabea concluded, \"We are confident that the Suez Canal will continue to play a pivotal role in global trade, and we remain committed to investing in its infrastructure and services to ensure its long-term success.\""}

It's never-ending.\"\n\nIntelligence warnings had indicated a potential terror threat from the Islamic State, and the explosions occurred outside the airport's Abbey Gate and the nearby Baron Hotel, both popular targets for attackers.\n\nThe Taliban, who now govern Afghanistan, condemned the attack and blamed the presence of foreign forces for such incidents: \"We strongly condemn today's terrorist attack at Kabul airport,\" Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement. \"The presence of foreign forces is the main cause of such incidents.\"\n\nThe Emergency NGO reported 60 injured individuals arriving at their Kabul Surgical Center, with six dead on arrival.

According to the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), one person lost their life during the rescue efforts. The SCA reported this fatality among their 'most prominent losses' due to the incident.\n\nThe specifics of the death, including the identity and exact cause, remain unclear. The SCA has yet to release any official information regarding the deceased person or the circumstances surrounding their death.\n\nThe SCA also mentioned the sinking of a rescue boat and the redirection of 48 ships as additional losses due to the Ever Given's grounding. However, there are no records of a tugboat or marine unit sinking during the operation, which raises questions about the details provided.\n\nThe efforts to salvage the Ever Given, which ran aground on March 23 and was stuck for six days, unfolded amidst a global shipping crisis. The ship's impasse in the Suez Canal disrupted global trade for approximately six days, affecting an estimated $9.6 billion in global trade daily.\n\nThe SCA demands $600 million in compensation from Shoei Kisen Kaisha, the Japanese owner of the Ever Given, for the incident. This demand includes the cost of salvage operations, lost revenue, and other damages.\n\nThe ship's insurer, Tokyo Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance, considers the $600 million compensation demand too high. Initially, the SCA demanded $916 million from Shoei Kisen Kaisha.\n\nThe Ever Given was impounded in the Great Bitter Lake, around 30 miles from where it got stuck, until the compensation issue was resolved.\n\nThe SCA's compensation claim is not limited to the financial damages. The SCA believes that the Ever Given's grounding caused significant reputational damage. The Authority claims that the world's busiest shipping lane's image was tarnished due to the incident.\n\nShoei Kisen Kaisha and its insurers argue that the Ever Given's grounding was not entirely their fault. They maintain that the high winds and poor visibility on the day of the incident were significant contributing factors.\n\nThe Ever Given's salvage operation involved more than 30 tugboats, several dredgers, and a large crane. The SCA's statement about the loss of a tugboat remains an enigma, as no reports of a tugboat sinking during the operation have surfaced.\n\nThe SCA's compensation demand is not an isolated case. In 2015, Maersk Line paid the Suez Canal Authority $300,000 in compensation after one of its vessels, the MSC Daniela, ran aground in the canal.\n\nThe death of the individual during the Ever Given salvage operation raises concerns about the safety measures taken during the operation. The SCA and the international maritime community must address these concerns to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.\n\nThe tragic incident underscores the importance of the Suez Canal in global trade. The canal serves as a vital artery connecting Europe, Asia, and Africa, facilitating approximately 12% of the world's maritime trade.\n\nAs the investigation into the death of the individual continues, the maritime community, the shipping industry, and the international community wait for answers regarding the circumstances surrounding the fatality. The memory of the deceased person serves as a poignant reminder of the human cost of global trade disruptions."}

Code shared her experience with The Marshall Project, stating, \"I thought I was going to die.\"\n\nProsecutors in Chauvin's case intend to use Code's testimony and the details of her arrest to support their second-degree murder charge against him. A judge approved the use of Code's case but excluded five other instances of Chauvin's alleged use of excessive force from the trial.\n\nJulian Hernandez, another alleged victim, claimed Chauvin put him in a chokehold during an off-duty encounter in 2014. Hernandez told The Marshall Project, \"I couldn't breathe... I thought I was going to pass out.\"\n\nJimmy Bostic, a bystander during one of Chauvin's alleged use-of-force incidents in 2016, described witnessing Chauvin put a man in a headlock and mace him without cause. Bostic stated, \"It was like he was trying to intimidate or scare the guy.\"\n\nSir Rilee Peet, another alleged victim, claimed Chauvin and other officers maced and restrained him in 2019 after he asked for a ride. Peet shared, \"I thought they were going to kill me.\"\n\nMonroe Skinaway, an eyewitness to one of Chauvin's use-of-force incidents in 2017, described the scene, stating, \"I saw Derek Chauvin with his knee on the man's neck, and he wasn't moving. It looked like he was struggling to breathe.\"\n\nEric Nelson, Chauvin's lawyer, argued that these prior incidents were not unreasonable or unauthorized and that Chauvin committed no crimes. Nelson did not respond to requests for comment from The Marshall Project but stated in court papers that Chauvin acted reasonably during Floyd's arrest.\n\nCode's encounter with Chauvin began when she and her friends were waiting for a school bus in 2017. Code described how Chauvin approached them, stating, \"He asked us what we were doing, and I told him we were waiting for the bus.\"\n\nCode continued, \"He asked for our IDs, and I told him I didn't have it on me. That's when he grabbed me and put me in the back of his squad car.\"\n\nDuring the ride, Code alleged that Chauvin put his knee on her neck and pressed harder when she resisted, stating, \"I thought I was going to die. I couldn't breathe.\"\n\nHernandez's encounter with Chauvin occurred in 2014 when he was a passenger in a car that was pulled over for a broken taillight. Hernandez claimed Chauvin put him in a chokehold, stating, \"I couldn't breathe... I thought I was going to pass out.\"\n\nBostic described the incident he witnessed in 2016, stating, \"I saw Chauvin put a man in a headlock and mace him without cause. The man was unarmed, and he didn't resist.\"\n\nPeet recalled his encounter with Chauvin in 2019, stating, \"I asked for a ride, and the next thing I knew, they had me on the ground, macing me and putting handcuffs on me.\"\n\nPeet added, \"I thought they were going to kill me. I couldn't believe what was happening.\"\n\nSkinaway described the scene he witnessed in 2017, stating, \"I saw Chauvin with his knee on the man's neck, and he wasn't moving. It looked like he was struggling to breathe.\"\n\nThe Marshall Project interviewed several other alleged victims and witnesses, all people of color, who had violent encounters with Chauvin. Their stories shared striking similarities to Floyd's case.\n\nCode, Hernandez, Bostic, Peet, and Skinaway all expressed fear for their lives during their encounters with Chauvin, drawing parallels to Floyd's death."}

(AP) – U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey's (R-PA) vote to convict former President Donald Trump during his second impeachment trial has sparked anger from some Pennsylvania Republican Party committee members. A censure resolution against Toomey, who is not seeking reelection, is being considered, though it would be symbolic in nature.\n\nToomey, who was one of seven Republicans to vote to convict Trump of \"incitement of insurrection,\" has called for unity and tolerance of differing opinions regarding Trump's role in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. In a statement, he said, \"I strongly believe that we must learn from the past and move forward as a united country.\"\n\nState GOP Chair Lawrence Tabas has planned a meeting to discuss a potential censure resolution against Toomey. \"Senator Toomey's vote to convict a fellow Republican president without sufficient evidence was a betrayal,\" Tabas stated.\n\nJezree Friend, a state committee member from Erie County, echoed Tabas' sentiments. \"Senator Toomey's vote was a slap in the face to Republican voters,\" Friend said. \"He should be held accountable for his actions.\"\n\nHowever, Toomey's supporters argue that a \"Trump litmus test\" for loyalty is divisive and damaging to the party. Sam DeMarco, Chair of the Allegheny County Republican Party, said, \"We need to focus on moving forward as a party, not dwelling on the past.\"\n\nRadio host Dom Giordano of WPHT-AM also defended Toomey. \"Toomey may not be the most loyal Trump supporter, but he's been a consistent voice for conservative principles,\" Giordano stated.\n\nDespite backing many of Trump's policies, Toomey's reluctance to closely align with Trump has made him a target within his party. He argued against turning a blind eye when a president attempts illegal and unconstitutional means of staying in power. \"The fact pattern,\" Toomey said, \"I think is pretty damning.\"\n\nIn the past, Toomey was a champion for conservative challenges within the GOP. However, his objections to Trump's conduct have led to criticism from Trump loyalists. \"Toomey's vote to convict Trump is just the latest example of his disloyalty to the party and the president,\" said one Republican committee member, who requested anonymity.\n\nToomey's decision to retire from the Senate at the end of his term has taken some of the sting out of the potential censure. Nevertheless, the debate over his vote and its implications for the future of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania continues.\n\nAs the party grapples with its identity and direction, the censure debate serves as a reminder of the deep divisions that persist within its ranks. The outcome of this internal struggle remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the Pennsylvania Republican Party is at a crossroads.\n\n\"We need to come together as a party and focus on the issues that matter to Pennsylvanians,\" DeMarco emphasized. \"A censure resolution against Senator Toomey won't accomplish that.\"\n\nThe meeting to discuss the potential censure resolution against Toomey is scheduled for later this month. The outcome of the vote, if it occurs, remains uncertain. However, one thing is clear: the debate over Toomey's vote and its implications for the future of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania is far from over."}

The film's executive producers, Allen Cheney, Emily Salveson, and her Streamline Global finance company, have disavowed responsibility for the production, emphasizing their limited role in financing.\n\nAllen Cheney, speaking on behalf of the Rust production, said in a statement, \"Our involvement in 'Rust' was strictly financial. We did not have any operational involvement in the making of the film.\" Cheney and Salveson's Streamline Global had provided a significant portion of the film's budget, but they insisted that their involvement ended there.\n\nThe production faced criticism for allegedly cutting corners and hiring non-union crew members, which some believe may have contributed to the tragic incident. However, it is essential to note that an investigation is ongoing, and no definitive conclusions have been reached regarding the cause of the accident.\n\nBondit Media Capital, named as a co-financier, actually loaned money against distribution collateral without having an equity stake in the film. This financial arrangement raises questions about the production's financial management and potential oversights.\n\nMoreover, the film was not bonded, which is a common practice in the film industry to provide financial protection against cost overruns, accidents, and other unforeseen events. The lack of a bond could indicate further financial and management oversights.\n\nDistrict Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies has not ruled out Alec Baldwin as a person of interest in the investigation. Baldwin, who was handling the prop gun that discharged, has maintained that he did not pull the trigger intentionally.\n\nFinancial arrangements for \"Rust\" involved sales of North American distribution rights and foreign presales totaling $3 million. Emily Salveson and Ryan Donnell Smith, who have a background in financing through tax incentives and have been involved in other productions, are listed as owners of 'Rust Movie Productions LLC.' The company also has operational ties to Thomasville Pictures.\n\nMary Carmack-Altwies, commenting on the ongoing investigation, stated, \"We are still in the process of gathering and reviewing evidence. Our investigation is focused on determining how live ammunition came to be on the set and how it was discharged. We will follow the facts and the evidence wherever they lead.\"\n\nAs the investigation continues, the tragic incident on the set of \"Rust\" has brought renewed attention to the importance of adhering to safety protocols and proper financial management in film production."}

In an exclusive interview, Lundgren emphasized the importance of firearm safety on movie sets and the usual strict protocols.\n\n\"It's just tragic what happened on the 'Rust' set,\" said Lundgren. \"I've been in this business for a long time, and accidents do happen, but it's essential to have strict protocols in place to prevent such incidents.\"\n\nLundgren recalled a similar tragedy from his past, the 1993 shooting death of Brandon Lee during the filming of \"The Crow.\" \"It was a devastating experience,\" he said. \"The industry came together to implement stricter safety measures, and I believe we've made significant progress.

It is our hope that justice will be served.\"\n\nSvetnoy's attorney, James D. Rosner, shared, \"My client is deeply disturbed by the incident and is focused on recovering from his injuries and ensuring that such a tragedy never happens again.\"\n\nAccording to the Santa Fe New Mexican, Halls admitted that he did not check the gun's chamber before handing it to Baldwin, stating, \"I didn't do it, and I'll take responsibility for it.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Baldwin stated, \"Mr. Baldwin is fully cooperating with the police investigation, and he is in touch with the family of the victim.\"\n\nThe \"Rust\" production was suspended indefinitely following the incident.

The incident left the 45-year-old athlete with significant injuries, including open fractures to his lower right leg and ankle.\n\nAccording to Chief Medical Officer and interim CEO at Harbor-UCLA Medical Centre, Änish Mahajan, Woods underwent an extensive surgical procedure on his lower right leg and ankle. Mahajan shared details on the golfer's injuries during a press conference held at the hospital.\n\nÄnish Mahajan: \"Mr. Woods suffered significant orthopaedic injuries to his right lower extremity. The injuries include a comminuted open fracture in the upper portion of the tibia and fibula, as well as damage to the muscles and soft tissues in the leg.\"\n\nMahajan further explained that Woods underwent a successful surgery to stabilize the fractures with a rod, screws, and pins. In addition, he had a procedure to relieve pressure due to swelling in his leg muscles.\n\nAfter the surgery, Woods was reported to be awake, responsive, and recovering in the hospital. Mahajan confirmed that the golfer's condition was improving and that he was in stable condition.\n\nLos Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva shared that Woods was alone in the car during the accident, which occurred around 7:12 AM local time. Villanueva stated that there was no evidence of alcohol or substances influencing the crash.\n\nAlex Villanueva: \"We don't know what caused the crash. We don't know if it was an intentional act or if it was just an accident. Our investigation is ongoing, but at this point, we don't have any evidence of wrongdoing.\"\n\nThe first officer on the scene, Deputy Carlos Gonzalez, described the chaotic scene upon arrival. He noted that Woods' calmness during the ordeal may have played a role in potentially saving his life.\n\nCarlos Gonzalez: \"When I arrived, the car was lying on its side. Mr. Woods was conscious but visibly shaken. His seatbelt had held him in place, preventing more serious injuries.\"\n\nGonzalez also highlighted the importance of the car's airbags, which deployed during the accident, providing a crucial cushion for Woods. This cushioning likely helped minimize the damage to his upper body and head.\n\nWoods' wife, Elin Nordegren, was reportedly at the scene when the accident occurred. She was visibly shaken but otherwise unharmed. Nordegren accompanied Woods to the hospital, where she has remained by his side throughout his recovery.\n\nThe cause of the accident remains under investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Preliminary reports suggest that Woods may have lost control of the vehicle while driving at a relatively low speed.\n\nThe golfing community and fans around the world have rallied behind Woods during this difficult time. Many have expressed their well-wishes and support for the iconic athlete as he begins his long road to recovery.\n\nAs Woods continues to recuperate in the hospital, the world waits with bated breath for updates on his condition. Though the road to recovery will be long and challenging, the golfing legend's unwavering determination and resilience have left many optimistic about his prospects for a full recovery."}

In contrast to his predecessor's claims of record attendance, Biden's inauguration aims for a mostly virtual ceremony to ensure public safety.\n\nSean Spicer, the former White House Press Secretary under President Donald Trump, once famously declared that Trump's 2017 inauguration had the largest attendance ever. However, estimates suggested around 500,000 attendees, a far cry from Spicer's initial claim of 1.5 million people. This controversy over crowd size has led the federal government to cease making official estimates for large gatherings in Washington.\n\nRoy Blunt, the Missouri Republican Senator and Chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies (JCCIC), acknowledged the challenges of planning an inauguration during a pandemic. \"It's a very unusual situation,\" Blunt said in a statement. \"But we're going to make the best of it.\"\n\nPaige Waltz, Communications Director for the JCCIC, further elaborated on the plans for the 2021 inauguration. \"The Presidential Inaugural Committee and the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies are working together to ensure a safe and successful inauguration for the President-elect and Vice President-elect,\" she stated.\n\nTo minimize crowd sizes and adhere to public health guidelines, the 2021 inauguration events will be significantly scaled down. Only 1,000 people are expected to attend the swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol, a stark contrast to the hundreds of thousands who typically gather for the occasion. The traditional Inaugural Luncheon has been cancelled.\n\nInstead, the parade will be reimagined as a drive-by parade, with Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris waving to the public from the safety of their vehicles. Virtual events and live broadcasts will allow Americans from across the country to participate in the historic moment.\n\nBiden's inauguration will not be the first to face unique circumstances. Ronald Reagan's second inauguration in 1985 also faced adjustments due to dangerous weather conditions. But the pandemic-induced changes mark a new chapter in inaugural history.\n\nBarack Obama's 2009 inauguration holds the record for the largest unofficial turnout, with an estimated 1.8 million people in attendance.

Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, President-elect Joe Biden and his team are working diligently to ensure a safe and successful ceremony. With historical precedents such as Ronald Reagan's second inauguration in 1985 and Barack Obama's record-breaking 2009 inauguration to draw inspiration from, the 2021 inauguration promises to be a testament to the resilience and adaptability of the American people in the face of adversity.\n\n\"It's a very unusual situation,\" Roy Blunt, Missouri Republican Senator and Chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, acknowledged. \"But we're going to make the best of it.\"\n\nPaige Waltz, Communications Director for the JCCIC, echoed Blunt's sentiments, stating, \"The Presidential Inaugural Committee and the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies are working together to ensure a safe and successful inauguration for the President-elect and Vice President-elect.\"\n\nSean Spicer, the former White House Press Secretary under President Donald Trump, once claimed that Trump's 2017 inauguration had the largest attendance ever.

The payments, which aim to provide financial relief to individuals and families affected by the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, are being disbursed through direct deposit, paper checks, and prepaid debit cards.\n\nAbout 8 million debit cards have been distributed, according to the IRS. Recipients who receive the cards should be aware that they may initially mistake them for junk mail. The cards come in a white envelope bearing the Treasury Department seal and are issued by MetaBank.\n\nThe debit cards can be used for purchases, ATM withdrawals, and transferring funds without fees. Individuals earning less than $75,000 and couples earning less than $150,000 are eligible for the full $600 payment. Payment phases out at $87,000 for single filers and $174,000 for joint filers without children.\n\nUndocumented immigrants without Social Security numbers are ineligible for the payments. However, their spouses and children who have Social Security numbers can receive the payments. Dependents, including some college students, are ineligible for the payments.\n\nTo check the status of their stimulus payments, individuals can use the IRS's Get My Payment online tool. The tool allows users to see when their payment was sent, the method by which it was delivered, and whether there were any issues with their payment. The IRS encourages those who have not received their payments to use this tool to ensure their information is up to date.\n\nThe $600 stimulus payments are a part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which was signed into law on December 27, 2020. The legislation also includes funding for various government programs and provides for disaster relief and other initiatives.\n\nThe IRS emphasizes that taxpayers do not need to take any action to receive their stimulus payments if they have already provided their banking information to the IRS. Those who have not provided their banking information will receive a paper check or prepaid debit card in the mail.\n\nThe IRS encourages taxpayers to be on the lookout for scams related to the stimulus payments. Scammers may attempt to contact individuals via phone, email, or text message, claiming to be from the IRS or other government agencies. The IRS reminds taxpayers that it will not contact them by email, text message, or social media and will not ask for personal or financial information unless the individual has already initiated contact or has a legitimate business need to provide the information.\n\nIn addition to the $600 stimulus payments, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, also includes provisions for a $300 weekly unemployment insurance supplement through March 14, 2021, and an extension of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) through March 31, 2021. The legislation also includes funding for vaccine distribution and testing, as well as various other initiatives.\n\nThe IRS encourages taxpayers to visit its website for more information on the stimulus payments and other tax-related matters. The agency reminds individuals that it is committed to helping taxpayers during these challenging times and urges them to stay informed and take advantage of the resources available to them."}

The incident highlighted the vulnerability of complex network environments to misconfigurations and human error.\n\nThe cause of the outage was a misconfiguration during routine maintenance on Facebook's backbone routers, which manage traffic between data centers. An incorrect command aimed to check capacity inadvertently disabled Facebook's border gateway protocol (BGP) routers, severing the connection between the data centers and the internet.\n\nFacebook's DNS servers, which translate domain names into IP addresses, were unable to function with the BGP routers offline. As a result, users were unable to access Facebook's sites or services.\n\nA bug in an audit tool failed to catch the mistake, allowing it to be deployed across Facebook's entire network environment. This underscores the potential for misconfigurations to go unnoticed in large, complex networks.\n\nAccording to Gartner, through 2023, 99% of firewall breaches will be due to misconfigurations, not the firewalls themselves. Misconfigurations can lead to major security breaches, as evidenced by the 2019 Capital One data breach, which affected over 100 million customers.\n\nHuman error, amplified by complex environments, is a leading cause of network and service outages. Misconfigurations can result from miscommunication, lack of training, or simple mistakes.\n\nThe Facebook outage serves as a reminder that misconfigurations can have far-reaching consequences. In this case, the disruption affected billions of users and caused significant financial and reputational damage to Facebook.\n\nMisconfigurations can compromise network security in various ways. They can allow unauthorized access, enable denial-of-service attacks, or expose sensitive data.\n\nIn the case of the Facebook outage, the misconfiguration disabled the BGP routers, effectively isolating the data centers from the internet.\n\nMisconfigurations can be difficult to detect, particularly in large, complex networks. Automated tools and continuous monitoring are essential for identifying and addressing misconfigurations before they cause significant damage.\n\nFireMon offers tools for managing network security policies and minimizing misconfigurations that could compromise network security. Their solutions provide real-time visibility into network security policies and help organizations identify and remediate misconfigurations.\n\nThe Facebook outage highlights the importance of a proactive approach to network security. Regular audits, training, and automated tools can help organizations minimize the risk of misconfigurations and the damage they can cause.\n\nThe incident also underscores the need for disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Organizations should have contingencies in place to minimize the impact of outages and ensure business continuity.\n\nThe Facebook outage serves as a cautionary tale for organizations of all sizes. Misconfigurations can have serious consequences, and it's essential to prioritize network security and minimize the risk of human error.\n\nAs networks become increasingly complex, the challenge of managing security policies and minimizing misconfigurations grows. Organizations must invest in the right tools and processes to ensure the security and reliability of their networks.\n\nIn conclusion, the Facebook outage was a stark reminder of the potential consequences of misconfigurations and human error in complex network environments. It underscores the importance of a proactive approach to network security, continuous monitoring, and automated tools for managing security policies and minimizing misconfigurations."}

The proposed ads aimed to display the types of personal information Facebook uses for targeted advertising. However, the social media giant allegedly responded by shutting down Signal's advertising account.\n\nAccording to a blog post published by Signal, they wanted to run ads that showed users the \"precise, granular, and often sensitive personal information that Facebook collects and uses to target its users with ads.\" The blog post went on to state that Facebook's opaque data usage practices were a concern for both Signal and its users.\n\nThe blog post included examples of the types of ads Signal wanted to run. One example showed a mock-up of a Facebook ad with a user's name, age, location, interests, and relationship status displayed. Another example showed Facebook's detailed targeting options, which can include income level, job title, and even purchase behavior.\n\nSignal's CEO, Moxie Marlinspike, took to Twitter to share another ad example, emphasizing the granularity of Facebook's targeting capabilities. He wrote, \"Facebook is very clear about what they do: they sell highly detailed targeting information about their users to advertisers.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Facebook has taken action against ads critical of the company. In 2019, Facebook removed ads from Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign, which called for the social media giant to be regulated like a utility.\n\nFacebook's ad business, which is heavily reliant on data tracking, has been a significant contributor to the company's revenue growth. In its Q3 2020 earnings report, Facebook reported ad revenue of $21.5 billion, a 22% year-over-year increase.\n\nFacebook has expressed concerns about Apple's upcoming privacy updates, which could impact its ad business. Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature will require apps to ask users for permission to track their activity across other apps and websites.\n\nThe controversy around WhatsApp's recent terms of service changes highlighted the ongoing debate on personal data sharing. The changes, which would allow WhatsApp to share user data with Facebook, sparked a backlash from users and privacy advocates.\n\nSignal's move to buy Instagram ads and expose Facebook's data collection practices is part of a larger trend of companies and individuals pushing back against data-hungry tech giants. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the amount of personal data that is being collected and used for targeted advertising.\n\nHowever, some argue that targeted advertising can be beneficial for users, as it allows them to see ads that are relevant to their interests and needs. Facebook argues that its ad business helps businesses reach their target audiences and drives economic growth.\n\nDespite the benefits, there are valid concerns about the potential risks of data collection and targeted advertising, particularly when it comes to privacy and security. Signal's move to buy Instagram ads and expose Facebook's data collection practices is a reminder of the importance of transparency and user control in the digital age.\n\nAs the debate around data collection and targeted advertising continues, it is important for tech companies to be transparent about their practices and give users control over their data. Only then can we ensure that the benefits of targeted advertising outweigh the risks."}

(AP) – A cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline, which delivers approximately 45% of the East Coast's fuel, has caused panic-buying and long lines at gas stations, prompting concerns over fuel supply and leading to price hikes. Jeanette McGee, spokeswoman for the American Automobile Association (AAA) auto club, expressed her concerns, saying, \"With Memorial Day weekend just around the corner, this is not the news drivers wanted to hear.\"\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline was shut down due to the cyberattack on May 7, 2021. According to Jamar Gatison, a construction worker and Uber Eats driver in Clemmons, \"I've been seeing long lines at gas stations for days now. People are really worried.\" However, government officials and energy analysts have clarified that there is no gasoline shortage, but a distribution issue due to the pipeline shutdown.\n\nMair Martinez, a landscaper in Raleigh-Durham, reported that 28% of gas stations in North Carolina were out of fuel, with some areas experiencing much higher numbers, such as 72% in the Raleigh-Durham region. In response, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on May 10, 2021, to ease fuel transportation into the state.\n\nThe national average price for a gallon of gasoline rose above $3 for the first time since 2016, according to AAA. With over 37 million Americans expected to travel during the Memorial Day weekend, anticipating a significant increase in fuel demand, officials are seeking alternative transportation routes for fuel to mitigate the disruption.\n\nJohnathan King, an employee at a towing company in Greensboro, NC, stated, \"We've been receiving a lot of calls about cars running out of gas on the side of the road. It's been a busy few days.\"\n\nJen Psaki, White House press secretary, announced that the U.S. government is coordinating efforts to prevent fuel shortages, including allowing certain states to transport overweight loads of fuel. The Department of Homeland Security is prepared to review Jones Act waiver requests to alleviate fuel shortages.\n\nPsaki emphasized, \"We want to reassure the American people that there is no fuel shortage in this country. We have ample supply, and we're working to ensure that it gets to where it needs to go as quickly as possible.\"\n\nMcGee from AAA noted, \"We're encouraging drivers to conserve fuel as much as possible during this time. Simple steps like carpooling, combining errands, and staying home if you don't need to travel can help ease the strain on fuel supplies.\"\n\nCooper expressed his concern, stating, \"This situation is serious, and we need to take swift action to get fuel moving again. That's why I've declared a state of emergency to help expedite the transportation of fuel into North Carolina.\"\n\nMartinez, the landscaper, added, \"I just hope this gets resolved soon. I need gas to get to my job sites and keep my business running.\"\n\nGatison, the construction worker and Uber Eats driver, shared, \"I've had to cancel a few rides because I ran out of gas myself. It's a tough situation for a lot of people.\"\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, the East Coast grapples with the uncertainty of when the Colonial Pipeline will be back online and when fuel supplies will return to normal. The AAA, government officials, and energy analysts urge patience and conservation as efforts are made to mitigate the disruption caused by the cyberattack."}

Immediate Past President of the AMA, Susan R. Bailey, M.D., emphasizes the critical role these professionals play in ensuring patient and colleague safety during this ongoing pandemic.\n\n[Quote from Susan R. Bailey, M.D.] \"As health care professionals, we have a responsibility to protect our patients, colleagues, and the communities we serve. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and its variants. I urge all health care and long-term care employers to implement mandatory vaccination policies to safeguard public health.\"\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over 300 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the United States, demonstrating their safety and efficacy. Nearly 4 billion doses have been administered globally, further validating the vaccines' success in combating the virus.\n\nHealth care and long-term care organizations, including the AMA, support mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for their employees to protect vulnerable populations and maintain the integrity of their workforces. This stance is endorsed by the CDC, American Nurses Association, and the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, among others.\n\n[Quote from the American Nurses Association] \"Nurses are committed to the health and safety of their patients, their colleagues, and their communities. Vaccination against COVID-19 is an essential component of that commitment. We stand with the AMA in advocating for mandatory vaccination policies in health care and long-term care settings.\"\n\nThe current surge in COVID-19 cases, fueled by contagious variants and unvaccinated populations, underscores the importance of vaccination. According to the World Health Organization, the Delta variant accounts for over 95% of new COVID-19 infections in the United States. This increase in cases highlights the urgency of vaccinating as many people as possible, particularly health care and long-term care workers.\n\nDespite the overwhelming evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, many health care and long-term care workers remain unvaccinated. This puts not only their own health at risk but also that of their patients, colleagues, and the vulnerable populations they serve.\n\n[Quote from the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living] \"Ensuring our workforce is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 is essential to maintaining the health and safety of long-term care residents. Mandatory vaccination policies provide a clear expectation and help protect the most vulnerable among us.\"\n\nWhile some workers may be exempt from mandatory vaccination policies due to medical reasons, they represent a minority of the workforce. Existing vaccine mandates, such as those for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), have proven effective in protecting public health. However, historical mistrust in health care institutions must be addressed to ensure the successful implementation of these policies.\n\n[Quote from Susan R. Bailey, M.D.] \"It's crucial that we address the concerns of those who are hesitant about vaccines. Open dialogue, education, and transparency are key to building trust and encouraging vaccination. We are committed to working with health care and long-term care employers to implement these policies in a thoughtful and equitable manner.\"\n\nThe health care community's leadership in implementing vaccine mandates serves as a model for all employers. By prioritizing the health and safety of their workforce and the communities they serve, health care organizations can help combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and protect vulnerable populations.\n\n[Quote from Susan R. Bailey, M.D.] \"As leaders in the health care community, we have a responsibility to set an example. By implementing mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policies, we can protect our patients, colleagues, and the public at large.

A year later, it was expanded to include North Korea, Venezuela, and Chad. In February 2020, six additional countries - Myanmar, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania - were added, sparking international criticism.\n\nRamez Alghazzouli, a Syrian American whose family was affected by the ban, expressed relief: \"My family and I have gone through a lot of anxiety and uncertainty due to this policy. Now, we can finally breathe a sigh of relief.\"\n\nThe travel ban, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in its third version, faced criticism for being discriminatory. Over 41,000 people were denied visas due to the ban, with waivers being difficult to obtain. Enrollment from affected countries in U.S. educational institutions and certain professions like healthcare saw a significant decline.\n\nElizabeth Neumann, former Assistant Secretary for Counterterrorism and Threat Prevention at the Homeland Security Department, argued that the ban did not enhance national security: \"The travel ban did not make us any safer. In fact, it damaged our international relationships and undermined U.S. values.\"\n\nFormer intelligence officials and ambassadors also criticized the ban for its focus on Islamist terrorism. Ryan Crocker, former U.S. Ambassador to Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, and Kuwait, stated: \"The travel ban did not address the root causes of terrorism. Instead, it unfairly targeted entire communities, creating resentment and fueling extremism.\"\n\nThe rescinding of the ban fulfills one of Biden's campaign promises on immigration policy. Biden has also pledged to expand refugee admissions and reunite families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border under the previous administration.\n\nImmigrant advocates urge further action from the Biden administration and Congress to dismantle Trump's immigration policies and barriers. They call for an end to the border wall construction, the reinstatement of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nThe lifting of the travel ban marks a significant shift in U.S. immigration policy. However, it is just one step in a larger process to repair the damage caused by the previous administration's anti-immigrant stance. The Biden administration faces a challenging road ahead as it works to create a more welcoming and inclusive immigration system."}

We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are just too great. Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.\"\n\nTwitter, too, took action against Trump. A Twitter spokesperson said, \"After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them — specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter — we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.\"\n\nYouTube, Google's video-streaming platform, removed a Trump video for violating policies on election fraud claims but allowed it with sufficient context.

An anonymous CNN employee told The Washington Post, \"It's a betrayal of journalistic standards, and it's going to hurt the network in the long run.\"\n\nDespite controversies, including receiving priority access to coronavirus testing and avoiding coverage of his brother's scandals, Chris Cuomo has continually had Zucker's support. In a statement to The Washington Post, Zucker said, \"Chris has not only reported on these stories fairly but has been a leading voice in our coverage.\"\n\nFollowing the revelation of his involvement in his brother's defense strategies, Chris Cuomo apologized on air, emphasizing \"family first, job second.\" However, The Washington Post article exposing the ethical breach met with mixed reactions at CNN, with some employees viewing his apology as insufficient. A senior CNN producer told The Washington Post, \"It's hard to take him seriously anymore.\""}

Northeastern University's head team physician, Gian Corrado, shared his concerns about Woods's prospects for a full recovery and return to championship form.\n\n\"Tiger's injuries are extensive, and the road to recovery will be long,\" Corrado stated. \"There's a possibility that he could be hospitalized for several weeks, and he might need a stabilizing frame for his leg to facilitate the healing process.\"\n\nCorrado, who is also the Associate Director of the Sports Medicine Fellowship Program at Boston Children's Hospital, went on to express doubts about Woods's ability to regain his championship golf form. \"Given the nature of his injuries, it's unrealistic to expect a swift return to competitive golf. It's important to remember that everyone heals differently.\"\n\nMoreover, Corrado raised concerns about Woods's mental and emotional wellbeing during the recovery process. \"Being away from the game for an extended period can take a toll on a professional athlete's mental and emotional health. Tiger's history of substance abuse adds another layer of complexity to his situation.\"\n\nHowever, Dan Boothby, who oversees Northeastern's athletic trainers, physical therapists, and strength-and-conditioning coaches, emphasized the importance of Woods's emotional healing. \"Tiger's focus should be on his survival and healing, not on a potential return to golf. The mental and emotional aspects of his recovery are just as critical as the physical.\"\n\nBoothby added that rehabilitation would likely begin with gentle exercises, facing potential setbacks along the way. \"The recovery process for Tiger is predicted to be long, and there will undoubtedly be challenges. It's essential that he remains patient and committed to his rehabilitation program.\"\n\nDespite the grim outlook, Corrado and Boothby expressed optimism about Woods's potential for a successful recovery. \"Tiger's resilience and determination have gotten him through challenging situations in the past,\" Corrado said. \"I believe he has what it takes to overcome this latest obstacle and come back stronger than ever.\"\n\nBoothby concurred, stating, \"Tiger's support system, including his family, friends, and medical team, will play a crucial role in his recovery. With their help, I have no doubt that he will overcome these challenges and emerge stronger than before.\"\n\nAccording to law enforcement reports, there were no signs of substance influence at the crash scene, putting to rest any immediate concerns about a potential relapse. Nevertheless, Corrado and Boothby reiterated the importance of Woods addressing his past substance abuse issues as part of his overall recovery process.\n\n\"Substance abuse can have long-lasting effects on an individual's physical and mental health,\" Corrado explained. \"It's essential that Tiger addresses any underlying issues to ensure a successful and sustainable recovery.\"\n\nBoothby echoed Corrado's sentiments, stating, \"Tiger's journey to recovery will be a marathon, not a sprint. It will require patience, determination, and a strong support system. But I believe he has what it takes to overcome these challenges and emerge stronger than ever.\""}

Youngkin, who has received the endorsement of former President Donald Trump, maintains a careful distance from the polarizing figure, emphasizing his focus on issues and his desire to unite the state.\n\nYoungkin, a political newcomer, has made education a cornerstone of his campaign, criticizing McAuliffe's tenure as governor for not doing enough to address the needs of parents and students. McAuliffe, a seasoned politician and former governor, has countered by highlighting his record on education and economic development. FiveThirtyEight gives Youngkin a slight lead the day before the election, but the race remains extremely close.\n\nBoth candidates spent the final weekend before the election campaigning heavily across the state, with Loudoun County being a critical area for both campaigns. Loudoun County, located in the northern part of the state, is emblematic of broader national cultural battles, as it has seen heated debates over mask mandates and critical race theory in schools.\n\nGlenn Youngkin emphasized the importance of Loudoun County during a campaign stop there on Saturday, stating, \"We're going to win Loudoun County, and when we win Loudoun County, we're going to win this election.\"\n\nTerry McAuliffe, speaking to supporters in Fairfax County on Sunday, expressed confidence in his ability to win Loudoun County, stating, \"We've got this. We're going to win Loudoun County, and we're going to win this election.\"\n\nHowever, the race has sparked intense feelings and concerns over potential confrontations between opposing supporters. During a McAuliffe campaign event in Loudoun County on Saturday, a Youngkin supporter disrupted the event, leading to a tense moment between the two camps.\n\nGlenn Youngkin commented on the incident, stating, \"I don't condone that behavior. We need to come together as a community and focus on the issues that matter to Virginians.\"\n\nTerry McAuliffe echoed Youngkin's sentiment, stating, \"We need to have a civil discourse. We need to focus on the issues and not let emotions get the best of us.\"\n\nThe outcome of the Virginia governor's race is expected to provide valuable insights into the political climate leading into the 2022 midterms. Despite Youngkin's lead, McAuliffe is expected to win in Loudoun County, though analysts are watching Youngkin's performance there closely. Regardless of the outcome, one thing is clear: the cultural battles being waged in Virginia are a harbinger of things to come in the world of politics."}

I played most of my career with Joe, and we had some incredible moments together.\" (Jerry Rice, 95.7 The Game)\n\nRice emphasized the difference in eras and how the game is played as a reason for his preference for Montana. He pointed out that the NFL today is less physically demanding on players, especially quarterbacks, as compared to the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nMontana and Rice connected for an impressive 386 receptions, 6,710 yards, and 67 touchdowns in 77 games. Their on-field chemistry and success set the standard for the modern NFL quarterback-receiver duo.\n\nHowever, it's essential to acknowledge Tom Brady's accomplishments. Brady, now with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, has won six Super Bowl championships over the past 20 years. His postseason record stands at an impressive 32-11, showcasing his consistent success under pressure.\n\nMontana's postseason record is equally impressive, with a 16-7 record. Montana, known as \"Joe Cool,\" never lost a Super Bowl and took home three Super Bowl MVP awards. Brady, on the other hand, has lost three Super Bowls but has won a record-tying seven Super Bowl MVP awards.\n\nDespite the impressive statistics and accolades for both quarterbacks, Rice stays loyal to the 49ers and Montana. He explained, \"I've been asked this question many times, and my answer will always be the same. Joe Montana was my quarterback, and he led us to four Super Bowl victories.\" (Jerry Rice, 95.7 The Game)\n\nChanges in NFL rules to protect quarterbacks, such as the rule change following Brady's 2008 season injury, have impacted the way the game is played. The rules aim to prevent intentional hits on quarterbacks, making the game less physically demanding in some aspects.\n\nThe debate between Montana and Brady extends beyond championships and individual statistics. It centers on personal preferences for the era of play and quarterback style. Montana's poise, accuracy, and ability to lead a team to victory in the clutch have earned him a place in football history. Brady's resilience, adaptability, and consistency have redefined the quarterback position in the modern NFL.\n\nRice concluded, \"Both quarterbacks have had incredible careers, and it's an honor to have been a part of Joe Montana's. The debate will continue, but for me, Montana will always be the greatest.\" (Jerry Rice, 95.7 The Game)"}

The revelation has caused a significant crisis within the royal establishment, with Buckingham Palace confirming that the couple will not return to their previous roles and Harry will relinquish his honorary military titles.\n\nPrince Harry's interview with ITV's Tom Bradby, which aired on March 7, 2021, provided insight into the couple's thought process behind their departure from the royal family. The Duke of Sussex expressed his deep disappointment with how his personal life has been portrayed in the media, stating, \"I thought I was part of the solution, not the cause of the problem. I became aware, through that process, that the only way to prevent this rising danger is to go myself.\"\n\nThe couple has since moved to Los Angeles and has been engaging with more sympathetic media figures, such as James Corden, who interviewed Harry prior to the scheduled prime-time interview with Oprah Winfrey. In his interview with Corden, Harry expressed feeling more comfortable with the depiction of royal life in the Netflix series \"The Crown\" than in the newspapers.\n\nMeanwhile, Meghan has won a privacy claim against the Mail on Sunday for publishing a letter she sent her father, Thomas Markle. The court ruling marks a significant victory for the couple in their ongoing battle against intrusive media coverage.\n\nDespite not returning as working royals, Harry and Meghan insist that their move does not equate to walking away from public service. \"We can't live in this environment as parents. It's just not safe, and it's not fair,\" Harry stated in the ITV interview. \"Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the commonwealth, and my military associations, but without the constitutional constraints that limit us otherwise.\"\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex have remained largely out of the public eye since their departure, but their private lives have continued to make headlines.

The Austin resident described the ordeal in an interview, \"We had no power or water for over a week. We had to buy water and heaters to survive. It's been a financial struggle.\"\n\nThe storm disproportionately affected Black and Latino communities, exacerbating existing disparities.

Here in Connecticut, Republican lawmakers have continued to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and advocate for policies that disproportionately impact communities of color.\n\nIliana Pujols, Policy Director at the Connecticut Justice Alliance, emphasized the challenge of combating these deeply ingrained biases: \"We need to recognize that systemic racism is not an issue that can be solved overnight. It's a complex problem that requires a multifaceted solution.\"\n\nThe inconsistencies in our criminal justice system are not limited to the Rittenhouse case. Consider the infamous Brock Turner case, where the former Stanford University student received a lenient six-month sentence for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman.

It's influenced by societal biases and systemic inequalities that disproportionately impact communities of color.\"\n\nConnecticut's elected officials have failed to offer effective solutions for crime prevention and juvenile justice. Instead, they have resorted to fear-mongering and the over-policing of boundaries between cities and suburbs, which Pujols described as \"security theater.\" New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker's plan for citywide surveillance and Governor Ned Lamont's approach to juvenile detention only serve to exacerbate these issues.\n\nMike Lawlor, an Associate Professor of Criminal Justice at the University of New Haven, advocated for alternative strategies: \"We need to invest in our communities and focus on deterrents that address the root causes of crime. That means providing resources for education, employment, and mental health services.\"\n\nCrime patterns in our state, particularly auto thefts, are linked to broader societal issues like the pandemic and the reaction to George Floyd's death.

However, as he celebrates this milestone, Brady's thoughts still linger on the New England Patriots' heartbreaking loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII.\n\nDuring an interview with NBC Sunday Night Football reporter Michelle Tafoya, Brady jokingly mentioned his inability to catch a pass during that fateful game. \"I mean, I can't even catch a pass in a trick play, right?\" he quipped, referring to a botched attempt in the fourth quarter.\n\nDirector Gotham Chopra, who documented Brady's personal life in the Facebook documentary series 'Tom vs. Time,' shed light on the mental toll the Super Bowl loss took on the quarterback. \"Tom's not one to dwell on the past, but that loss to the Eagles still stings,\" Chopra shared. \"You can see it in his eyes when he talks about it.\"\n\nThe recent matchup between Brady and his former coach, Bill Belichick, and the Buccaneers' victory over the Patriots drew a massive audience, with approximately 27.2 million viewers tuning in. According to Sports Media Watch writer Jon Lewis, the game achieved the highest viewership for Sunday Night Football since 2015.\n\nDespite the captivating showdown and impressive ratings, the game did not break into the top five regular-season broadcasts of all time. Lewis explained, \"While the viewership was impressive, it was not enough to surpass the top five broadcasts, which are typically NFL conference championship games or the Super Bowl itself.\"\n\nMeanwhile, football fans were left disappointed as the Manning brothers, Eli and Peyton, did not call the upcoming Eagles vs. Panthers game on Monday Night Football. Eli humorously interacted with fans on Twitter, writing, \"Hey @EaglesFans, sorry we couldn't make it this week.

I wanted to let you all know that I fully cooperated with the investigation over the past few days. In the end, it was a decision made not by me but by the leadership at CNN. I never intended for any of my actions to cause harm to my colleagues in the CNN newsroom, nor to the network's reputation.\"\n\nZucker emphasized the complexity of such decisions in his email to staff: \"It goes without saying that these are very difficult decisions, and they are not made lightly.

Internal emails between Chris Cuomo and his colleagues were made public, raising questions about his impartiality.\n\nThe firing leaves a notable gap in CNN's prime-time lineup. CNN's Brian Stelter, who covers media for the network, tweeted, \"CNN's Chris Cuomo has been terminated, effective immediately.

In a statement to The New York Times in 2019, Chris Cuomo acknowledged the incident: \"I acknowledge that I groped her back then, and I took it in the context of being playful. I apologized to her then, and I meant it.\"\n\nThe woman, Shelley Ross, who was a senior executive producer at ABC at the time, wrote an op-ed for The New York Times in 2021 detailing the incident and criticizing CNN for keeping Chris Cuomo on the air despite his brother's scandal."}

The decision came after the violent storming of the U.S. Capitol, which left five people dead.\n\nBoth critics and supporters of Trump accused Twitter of having double standards in its treatment of the two leaders. The Iranian Supreme Leader has a history of posting strong comments against Israel, prompting discussions on Twitter's enforcement of its violence incitement policy.\n\nU.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai highlighted Khamenei's anti-Israel posts as a concern for potential glorification of violence during a Fox News interview: \"There have been numerous examples of Ayatollah Khamenei using Twitter to incite violence against Israel, and Twitter has done nothing about it.\"\n\nJason Brodsky, Policy Director of United Against Nuclear Iran, criticized Twitter for not applying its incitement of violence policy uniformly: \"Twitter banning Trump doesn't absolve them of their failure to address Khamenei's long record of violent threats against Israel and other nations.\"\n\nTwitter's statement on the matter defended the platform's actions, stating they focused on the harm presented by Trump's account: \"After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.\"\n\nRegarding Khamenei's account, Twitter stated: \"We took enforcement action on a Tweet from Ayatollah Khamenei's English language account for violating our policies regarding the glorification of violence. The account remains suspended from tweeting new content but can still receive direct messages.\"\n\nTwitter plans to expand its 'government account' labeling to officials of nations beyond the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. This move may include Khamenei's account, giving users more context and transparency about the accounts they engage with.\n\nKhamenei's controversial tweet called COVID-19 vaccines from the U.S., Britain, and France \"untrustworthy,\" alleging attempts to \"contaminate\" other nations. Iranian activists called for Khamenei's account suspension for spreading misinformation about vaccines; Twitter removed the tweet.\n\nNafiseh Kohnavard, Middle East Correspondent for the BBC, noted the confusion among Iranians over Twitter's decision: \"Many Iranians are baffled by Twitter's decision to suspend Trump's account while allowing Khamenei's to remain active, given that the platform is blocked in Iran.\"\n\nTrump's account was a significant source of his influence during his presidency, boasting over 88 million followers. Khamenei's English account, which has over 1 million followers, serves as an essential tool for communicating with the international community.\n\nAjit Pai emphasized the importance of holding all world leaders accountable for their actions on social media: \"It's crucial for social media companies to enforce their policies consistently and transparently, regardless of who the offender is.\"\n\nTwitter's inconsistent application of its policies towards Trump and Khamenei has raised concerns about the platform's ability to maintain a fair and balanced approach to content moderation.\n\nThe decision to ban Trump's account sparked debates about the role of social media in shaping public discourse and the responsibilities of tech giants in moderating content.\n\nKhamenei's anti-vaccine tweet comes at a time when the global community is working together to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Misinformation about vaccines can undermine public health efforts and potentially put lives at risk.\n\nTwitter's suspension of Khamenei's account for the controversial tweet sends a strong message about the importance of accurate information during a global health crisis.\n\nAs social media continues to play a significant role in shaping global conversations, it is essential for tech companies to establish clear and consistent policies for content moderation and enforcement.\n\nThe future of Twitter's relationship with world leaders, particularly those with a history of controversial posts, remains uncertain. However, the platform's actions against Trump and Khamenei serve as a reminder of the power of social media and the responsibility that comes with it.\n\nQuote from Ajit Pai: \"There have been numerous examples of Ayatollah Khamenei using Twitter to incite violence against Israel, and Twitter has done nothing about it.\"\n\nQuote from Jason Brodsky: \"Twitter banning Trump doesn't absolve them of their failure to address Khamenei's long record of violent threats against Israel and other nations.\"\n\nQuote from Nafiseh Kohnavard: \"Many Iranians are baffled by Twitter's decision to suspend Trump's account while allowing Khamenei's to remain active, given that the platform is blocked in Iran.\""}

With 2 in 3 eligible individuals, or 189 million Americans, now fully vaccinated, the Administration is preparing for the potential authorization of the first COVID-19 vaccine for this age group.\n\nThe Administration's efforts to expand vaccination access have come a long way since the start of the President's term. In January 2021, just 2 million Americans were fully vaccinated. Since then, the Administration has procured enough vaccine for the country's 28 million children ages 5-11, pending FDA authorization.\n\nThe vaccination rollout for children ages 5-11 will depend on the independent FDA and CDC process. The Administration plans to begin shortly after the final CDC recommendation. States, Tribes, and territories will play a significant role in the rollout, with federal support including full reimbursement for vaccination operations.\n\nVaccination sites for children ages 5-11 will include doctors' offices, hospitals, pharmacies, community health centers, and school- and community-based sites. Over 25,000 pediatric and primary care provider sites will offer vaccinations, with efforts to increase the number of providers enrolled. The Administration is also partnering with the Children's Hospital Association to set up vaccination sites in over 100 children's hospital systems across the country.\n\nChildren's hospitals will work to make vaccines accessible in trusted, family-friendly settings and provide information to parents. They will ensure that the vaccination process is safe, efficient, and convenient for families. The Administration recognizes the importance of building trust and confidence in the vaccines among parents and caregivers.\n\nThe Administration remains committed to ensuring that COVID-19 vaccines are free and accessible to all Americans, including children. Once authorized, COVID-19 vaccines for children ages 5-11 will be provided at no cost. The Administration has also expanded vaccine distribution to community health centers and rural health clinics to reach underserved communities.\n\nThe Biden Administration will continue to prioritize the health and safety of all Americans, especially children, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As we await the FDA and CDC's authorization for vaccines for children ages 5-11, the Administration will continue to invest in vaccination efforts and expand access to testing, treatments, and resources for families and communities."}

Her story, filled with heartbreak and mystery, has captured the public's imagination on social media platforms, fueled by her large online following. Yet, as we grieve for Gabby and her family, it's crucial to acknowledge the profound implications her case holds for media coverage of missing persons, particularly women of color.\n\nGabby Petito's case exemplifies 'missing white woman syndrome,' a term coined to describe the disproportionate media attention given to cases involving missing white women, often at the expense of missing persons of color. This phenomenon highlights deep-rooted racial and class disparities, with media outlets and the public often failing to extend the same level of empathy, concern, and resources to the families of missing persons of color.\n\nThe extensive media coverage of Gabby Petito's case, while understandably fueled by public interest and compassion, raises important questions about the potential impact on policy priorities and resource allocation. In Wyoming alone, there are hundreds of missing Indigenous women, whose cases have received far less attention. The stark contrast between the extensive search efforts for Gabby and the lack of similar efforts for these women underscores the systemic inequalities that persist in our society.\n\nWomen of color, particularly Black and Indigenous women, are disproportionately affected by both violence and media neglect. According to the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center, Native American women are 10 times more likely to experience violence than white women, yet their cases receive far less media attention. Underreporting and poor coordination contribute to the lower official rates of missing Indigenous women. In fact, the FBI's National Crime Information Center reports that over 500,000 Native Americans were missing between 1961 and 2016, with only about 116 cases receiving national media coverage.\n\nThe extensive media attention given to Gabby Petito's case reflects broader societal issues, including violence against women and systemic racism. The reality is that, if Gabby had been Black, her case might not have received the same level of public attention. It's time for media outlets and the public to recognize the value and humanity of all missing persons, regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. By addressing these disparities and working to increase awareness and resources for all missing persons, we can create a more equitable and just society."}

In a Twitter poll conducted by Colorado Public Radio, about a third of Broncos fans revealed they refuse to root for either the Chiefs or Tom Brady in the Super Bowl.\n\nJulie Thuis, a diehard Broncos fan since the 1970s, expresses her frustration with both Super Bowl contenders: \"It's like choosing between the lesser of two evils. I don't want to root for the Chiefs, but I can't bring myself to support Tom Brady either.\"\n\nChristine Voss, another devoted Broncos fan, chooses Tampa Bay over the Chiefs, prioritizing the divisional rivalry over her personal dislike for Brady: \"I may not like Tom Brady, but the Chiefs are a bigger threat to our historical success in the AFC West.\"\n\nDave DeNovellis, a Broncos fan since the John Elway era, ponders the predicament: \"It's a tough call.

In response, Brady tweeted, \"If you don't want to root for me, that's fine. Just don't call yourself a Broncos fan.\"\n\nPatrick Mahomes and the Chiefs pose a significant threat to the Broncos' historical success in the AFC West. Since Mahomes took over as starting quarterback in 2018, the Chiefs have consistently outperformed the Broncos, making it difficult for fans to find solace in their long-standing rivalry.\n\nBroncos fans are now left to consider other criteria for choosing whom to support. Team connections to Colorado or rooting for the underdog could be potential factors in their decision-making process.\n\nAs the Super Bowl draws near, Broncos fans are left to wonder: which evil is less evil? Is it the team that has consistently challenged our dominance in the AFC West, or the quarterback we love to hate?\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, it's just a game. But for Broncos fans, it's so much more. It's a test of loyalty, a challenge to one's beliefs, and a reminder of the complexities of fandom.\n\nAs Julie Thuis puts it, \"I never thought I'd be in this position. But here we are. Two evils, and I have to choose. God help me.\"\n\nBut what if there is no God? What if the Super Bowl is just a cosmic joke, and we're all just pawns in a much larger game?\n\nIn the end, the choice is ours to make. Whether we choose to root for the Chiefs or the Buccaneers, let us not forget that, at the heart of it all, we are Broncos fans. And no matter what, we'll always have each other.\n\nSo, as we prepare for Super Bowl LV, let us remember the words of Cole Wist: \"I'll be rooting for the commercials. At least they're neutral.\"\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, we'll all be rooting for the same thing after all."}

A Jan. 5 FBI report detailed potential for \"war\" in Washington, which was shared with law enforcement agencies. Capitol Police and other officials were said to be unaware of serious concerns about Jan. 6.\n\nArmy Secretary Ryan McCarthy reportedly wasn't notified about the FBI warning, according to a report by The New York Times. The Pentagon offered assistance to Capitol Police three days before the riot, but the offer was turned down. Response teams were also reportedly delayed during the assault on the Capitol.\n\nThe riot resulted in at least five deaths, including one Capitol Police officer, and disrupted the peaceful transfer of power from the Trump administration to the Biden administration.\n\nSherwin emphasized the importance of the ongoing investigation. \"This is a very complex criminal investigation,\" he said. \"It's not just about the events of the 6th, but the planning and coordination before the event.\"\n\nThe FBI and other law enforcement agencies are urging anyone with information about the Capitol riot to come forward. \"We need the public's help to bring those responsible for this heinous attack on our democracy to justice,\" D'Antuono said."}

Some will view him as a hero, while others will portray him as a troubled teenager who took the law into his own hands.\n\nThe Rittenhouse trial and verdict have underscored the role of media in shaping public perception and the importance of accurate and unbiased reporting.

Pfizer and Moderna have secured over $60 billion in sales for 2021 and 2022, including initial vaccines and potential boosters.\n\nStephen Hoge, Moderna's president, said in an interview with Reuters, \"We're planning for multiple billion doses a year of our booster.\" Moderna expects to generate over $7.6 billion in revenue from boosters in 2023.\n\nPfizer expects a third dose to be necessary 6 to 8 months after full vaccination, with regular boosters afterward. Pfizer and Moderna may initially have greater pricing power for their boosters until more competitors enter the market.\n\nVamil Divan, an analyst at Mizuho Securities, said, \"Pfizer and Moderna could command a price premium for their boosters due to the first-mover advantage.\"\n\nDave Ross, executive at CSL's flu vaccine unit Seqirus, noted, \"There is a risk that the booster market could grow larger than the initial market, especially if annual boosters become necessary.\"\n\nAccording to Steve Chesney, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, \"The COVID-19 booster market could mimic the flu shot market, with developed country vaccination rates around 50% and notable competition keeping prices in check.\"\n\nDamien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar, stated, \"The Pfizer and Moderna boosters will likely be priced lower than their initial vaccines due to increased competition.\"\n\nBijan Salehizadeh, managing director at Navimed Capital, added, \"There's uncertainty on how many people will need boosters and how competition will affect the booster shot market.\"\n\nPfizer and Moderna's rivals, such as Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, and Sanofi, are also working on booster shots. The U.S. government is paying for the shots, which could prevent price increases and encourage mix-and-match booster strategies.\n\nThe World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency have yet to issue formal guidance on COVID-19 booster shots. Evidence of waning antibody levels and breakthrough infections supports the need for boosters, but the extent of necessity remains debated.\n\nStephen Hoge of Moderna noted, \"We need to ensure that the most vulnerable populations around the world have access to vaccines before considering boosters for others.\""}

The parish, located just a few miles from the school, became a gathering place for those in need of healing and support.\n\nThe shooting, which occurred on November 30, 2021, saw a 15-year-old Oxford High sophomore open fire in the school's cafeteria, reportedly firing 15 to 20 rounds from a semiautomatic handgun before surrendering to authorities. Three students, Tate Myre, Madisyn Baldwin, and Hana St. Juliana, lost their lives in the senseless violence.\n\nAs the community grappled with the shock and grief, St. Joseph Catholic Church opened its doors for a special Mass dedicated to healing. John Wurges, an attendee at the Mass, shared his thoughts, \"I felt the need to come here today, to be surrounded by the faith and love of this community. We all need each other right now.\"\n\nFather Jim Kean, the Pastor of St. Joseph, led the Mass, offering words of comfort and hope to those in attendance. Kean stated, \"Today, we come together as a community to pray for those who have been affected by this tragedy. We pray for the families of the victims, for the students and faculty at Oxford High School, and for our entire community.\"\n\nFather John Carlin, the Associate Pastor at St. Joseph, offered spiritual and emotional support to the attendees. Carlin emphasized, \"We are here to provide a listening ear and a comforting presence. We understand that this is a difficult time, and we want to help in any way we can.\"\n\nDetroit Archbishop Allen H. Vigneron expressed his heartbreak over the tragedy and offered prayers for the victims and their families. Vigneron stated, \"I am deeply saddened by this senseless act of violence. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who have been affected, and with the entire Oxford community.\"\n\nThe Mass was an opportunity for community members to come together, share their grief, and offer each other support. As the congregation sang hymns and recited prayers, the church was filled with a sense of unity and solidarity.\n\nEven non-Catholics attended the Mass, reflecting the community's solidarity in the face of tragedy. One community member, who preferred to remain anonymous, shared, \"I'm not Catholic, but I wanted to be here today. I wanted to show my support for this community and for those who have been affected by this tragedy.\"\n\nThe shooting is considered the worst school shooting in Michigan's history, leaving the community in shock and disbelief. Father Kean acknowledged the severity of the situation, stating, \"This is a dark day for our community. But we must remember that even in the darkest moments, there is always hope.\"\n\nGage Harris, an alumnus of St. Joseph School, shared his hopes and prayers for healing in the community. Harris stated, \"This tragedy has affected us all, and it's important that we come together to support each other. We will get through this, but it will take time and effort from all of us.\"\n\nIn the days following the shooting, St. Joseph Catholic Church continued to serve as a beacon of hope and support for the Oxford community. Father Kean and Father Carlin were available to offer counseling and spiritual guidance to those in need.\n\nCommunity members rallied around the victims' families, offering financial support, food, and other resources to help them cope with their loss. Neighboring parishes and schools also reached out to offer their support.\n\nThe Oxford community continued to mourn the loss of their loved ones, but they also began to focus on the healing process. Father Kean emphasized, \"Healing is a process, and it takes time. But with the support of our community and the love of God, we will get through this.\"\n\nThe Oxford High School community also began to focus on healing. Counselors were made available to students and faculty, and extra security measures were put in place to ensure the safety of the students.\n\nThe Oxford community continued to come together in the days and weeks following the shooting, holding vigils, memorial services, and other events to honor the victims and support each other.\n\nThe tragedy at Oxford High School served as a reminder of the importance of community and the power of faith in times of need. As Father Kean stated, \"We are all in this together, and with the love and support of our community and our faith, we will get through this.\"\n\nThe Oxford community continued to heal, but the memories of that tragic day would never be forgotten. Father Kean emphasized, \"We will always remember those we have lost, but we will also remember the love and support that carried us through this difficult time.\"\n\nThe community of Oxford, Michigan, continued to come together in the months and years following the shooting, demonstrating the power of faith, love, and community in times of need."}

McCain unequivocally stated, \"I believe the President of the United States committed an impeachable offense by inciting an insurrection.\"\n\nDespite her stance on impeachment, McCain reaffirmed her commitment to the Republican Party. \"I'm a proud Republican, and I will continue to fight for the values that I believe in,\" she declared. However, McCain did not hesitate to criticize the age of current Republican members of Congress, suggesting their advanced years might impact their concern for the party's future.\n\nThe McCain family, a prominent Republican dynasty in Arizona, has long been at odds with Trump. Public feuds between Meghan McCain and Trump, as well as Cindy McCain's endorsement of Joe Biden in the presidential election, have further strained relations. In response, the Arizona Republican Party censured Cindy McCain for her actions.\n\nVeteran broadcaster Katie Couric fueled the fire when she suggested that Trump supporters needed to be 'deprogrammed.' In response, Meghan McCain defended Trump supporters, stating, \"To imply that all Trump supporters or conservatives are similar to Marjorie Taylor Greene or Jake Angeli is not only misguided, but it's also dangerous and divisive.\"\n\nThe infighting within the Republican Party has reached a boiling point, with Representatives Matt Gaetz and Liz Cheney at the center of the controversy. Gaetz, a staunch Trump ally, has called for Cheney, who voted to impeach Trump, to step down from her position as House Republican Conference Chair.\n\nCheney responded, \"I will not be lectured about my loyalty to this party, and this country, by the Republicans who have propagated lies and falsehoods for power and political gain.\"\n\nMcCain found the internal conflicts within the GOP entertaining but unproductive. \"The infighting we're seeing within the Republican Party is not a new phenomenon,\" she acknowledged. \"But it's never been more apparent or more damaging to the party's future.\"\n\nMeghan McCain weighed in on the situation, \"We need to focus on moving forward, not on settling scores.

We need to come together and focus on the issues that truly matter to the American people.\"\n\nKatie Couric questioned, \"But how can you do that when there are still those who refuse to acknowledge the truth?\"\n\nMeghan McCain responded, \"By continuing to speak the truth and standing up for what is right.

The Rittenhouse trial, taking place in Kenosha, Wisconsin, involves the teenager charged with killing two people and wounding another during last year's protests. The Arbery trial, in Brunswick, Georgia, centers around three men accused of murdering Ahmaud Arbery as he jogged through their neighborhood.\n\nRittenhouse, 18, pleaded not guilty to charges, including homicide and possession of a firearm by a minor, on November 3, 2020, in the aftermath of the Kenosha protests. He claims he acted in self-defense when he shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber on August 25, 2020. Rittenhouse's legal team argues that he was acting as a citizen militia to protect businesses and property during the unrest.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Arbery case, Travis McMichael, Gregory McMichael, and William \"Roddie\" Bryan stand accused of murder and aggravated assault in the death of Ahmaud Arbery on February 23, 2020. McMichael, the father of one of the defendants, also plans to claim self-defense. Arbery, an unarmed Black man, was pursued by the trio in their pickup truck before being confronted and fatally shot.\n\nBoth cases have drawn national attention, not only due to their high-profile nature but also the significant role that video evidence plays in each trial. Chris Slobogin, a law professor at Vanderbilt University and the Director of the Criminal Justice Program, shares his perspective on the impact of video evidence: \"Video evidence can be both beneficial and problematic for the defense in these cases. It can be used to support a self-defense claim, but it can also potentially undermine it if it shows the defendant's actions leading up to the incident.\"\n\nJamie White, a veteran Michigan defense attorney, adds, \"The use of video evidence in the Rittenhouse and Arbery trials underscores the importance of a fair and impartial jury. These juries will need to sift through the evidence presented and make informed decisions based on the facts of each case.\"\n\nIn the Rittenhouse trial, video footage from the night of the shootings shows Rittenhouse being chased and surrounded by Rosenbaum and Huber before he fired his weapon. The defense argues that Rittenhouse acted in self-defense, while the prosecution contends that Rittenhouse instigated the confrontation.\n\nIn the Arbery case, video footage of the incident was not made public until months after Arbery's death. The footage shows the McMichaels and Bryan pursuing Arbery in their truck before the fatal confrontation. The defense has argued that the men believed Arbery was a burglar and were attempting to make a citizen's arrest.\n\nBoth cases have sparked heated discussions about race, self-defense laws, and gun rights. The Rittenhouse trial, in particular, has become a rallying point for those who support the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms. In the days leading up to the protests in Kenosha, former Kenosha city alderman Kevin Mathewson posted a Facebook call for \"patriots\" to defend the city. Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, heeded the call and traveled to Kenosha with a rifle.\n\nIn the Arbery trial, the racial undertones of the case have been a major point of contention. Ahmaud Arbery was an unarmed Black man, and the defendants are white. The case gained national attention when the footage of the incident was released, leading to widespread protests and calls for justice.\n\nLegal experts and attorneys involved in both cases emphasize the complexities that video evidence brings to each trial. Slobogin explains, \"The use of video evidence can be a double-edged sword. It can help to clarify what happened, but it can also be misleading if it's taken out of context.\"\n\nWhite adds, \"The defense teams in these cases will need to be strategic in how they present the video evidence to the jury. They'll need to ensure that the context is clear and that the jury understands the relevance of the footage to the self-defense claims.\"\n\nThe trials of Kyle Rittenhouse and the three men accused of killing Ahmaud Arbery are expected to continue into late 2021 or early 2022. Both cases have captured the nation's attention and have highlighted the complex issues surrounding self-defense, race, and the role of video evidence in criminal trials.\n\nSlobogin emphasizes the importance of a fair and impartial jury in both cases: \"The juries will need to carefully consider all the evidence presented and make informed decisions based on the facts of each case. It's crucial that they are not influenced by outside factors, such as media coverage or public opinion.\""}

The social media giant will also review and remove inauguration-related events that violate its policies and block U.S.-based events created by accounts outside of the country.\n\nFacebook's decision comes as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has warned of potential violence against federal buildings, law enforcement, and public officials in the lead-up to the inauguration. The DHS has indicated that domestic extremists pose a significant threat to the event. In light of this, Facebook is closely monitoring all content related to the inauguration for signs of violence or threats in Washington, D.C., and across all states.\n\nThe social media giant is not alone in its efforts to maintain security and prevent potential unrest. Twitter has suspended over 70,000 accounts for violating its policies related to the Capitol attack on January 6, and Amazon has taken action against sellers offering merchandise that could be used as weapons or to incite violence.\n\nFacebook's efforts extend beyond event management and content moderation. The company has also paused political advertising and restricted certain features for users who frequently violate its policies. This move aims to prevent the spread of misinformation and potential incitement to violence during this sensitive period.\n\nThese actions by Facebook and other tech companies follow the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, which saw a mob of supporters of President Donald Trump storm the building, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries. The event highlighted the potential for social media to be used as a tool for organizing and inciting violence.\n\nThe security concerns surrounding the inauguration are not unprecedented. In 2017, during President Trump's inauguration, over 21,000 National Guard troops were deployed to Washington, D.C., as a precaution against potential protests. However, the heightened threats this year, fueled by the Capitol attack and ongoing political tensions, have led to increased vigilance and action from law enforcement and tech companies.\n\nDespite these measures, concerns remain about the potential for violence and unrest during the inauguration. The DHS has issued multiple warnings about potential threats and has urged the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity. Law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal levels are working together to ensure the safety of those attending the inauguration and the general public.\n\nAs the inauguration approaches, it is clear that social media platforms and tech companies will play a crucial role in maintaining security and preventing the spread of misinformation and potential incitement to violence. The events of the past few weeks have underscored the importance of these efforts in an increasingly polarized political climate. Airbnb's decision to cancel all Washington D.C. reservations for inauguration week due to security concerns further illustrates the heightened sense of uncertainty and the need for precautionary measures.\n\n(Bonus) In conclusion, Facebook's decision to ban new events near the White House, U.S. Capitol, and state capitols until after Joe Biden's inauguration, along with its efforts to review and remove inauguration-related events that violate its policies, block U.S.-based events created by accounts outside of the U.S., and monitor for signs of violence or threats, is part of a broader trend among tech companies to enhance content moderation following the Capitol attack on January 6. The Department of Homeland Security has issued warnings about violence against federal buildings, law enforcement, and public officials, and social media platforms like Twitter and Amazon have taken steps against content believed to incite violence. Airbnb has canceled all Washington D.C. reservations for inauguration week due to security concerns. These measures reflect the heightened sense of uncertainty and the need for precautionary measures in the lead-up to the inauguration."}

The survey of 1,200 registered voters reveals broad support for winterization of electricity and gas facilities, government funding for weatherization, and accountability from lawmakers and energy providers.\n\nJames Henson, Executive Director of the Texas Politics Project, which conducted the poll, stated, \"The storm exposed significant weaknesses in our energy infrastructure, and Texans want action to address those issues.\"\n\nLarge majorities of respondents (75% for electricity and 64% for gas) blamed the lack of winterization of facilities for the storm's impact. An unprecedented storm (68%) also played a significant role in the outages. More than half of the respondents (52%) pointed to failures by Texas lawmakers as a contributing factor.\n\nThe poll results reveal that 85% of Texans support requiring energy providers to weatherize their facilities, while 53% favor government funding for weatherization. Proposals like ensuring higher energy reserves and requiring ERCOT board members to reside in Texas also received substantial support.\n\nThe storm's impact on Texans was significant. Sixty-six percent of respondents experienced electricity outages during the storm, with significant numbers reporting prolonged power loss (38%), internet issues (34%), and financial impacts (29%).\n\nGovernment entities received low approval ratings for their response to the storm. ERCOT, the Public Utility Commission, and the Railroad Commission of Texas received approval ratings of 25%, 29%, and 32%, respectively. Governor Greg Abbott received a 41% approval rating for his handling of the storm, slightly higher than the Texas Legislature and state-level entities.\n\nLocal governments were viewed more favorably in their response to the storm than state officials. Forty-two percent of respondents approved of their local government's response, while only 25% approved of the state government's response.\n\nHenson added, \"This poll underscores the urgency for action on energy infrastructure reforms in Texas. Texans are demanding accountability from their leaders and a more resilient energy system.\"\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin Texas Politics Project conducted the poll between February 22 and 25, 2021. The survey has a margin of error of +/- 2.83 percentage points."}

In an exclusive interview with a prominent news outlet, Baldwin expressed his condolences for the loss of his friend and cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, while cooperating with the ongoing investigation.\n\n\"This is a one in a trillion event,\" Baldwin stated, visibly emotional during the interview. \"Something like this should never happen. I cannot begin to fathom the pain Halyna's husband, son, and family are experiencing.\"\n\nBaldwin emphasized that he is fully cooperating with the authorities, speaking to them daily, but could not comment on the active investigation. He added, \"I'm just trying to help in any way I can. My focus is on supporting Halyna's family and ensuring that this never happens again.\"\n\nThe actor, who gained notoriety for his roles in films such as \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" and \"The Aviator,\" acknowledged the need for new safety measures on film sets to prevent future incidents. \"We need to take a hard look at how we handle firearms on set and find ways to make it safer for everyone involved,\" Baldwin emphasized.\n\nSheriff Adan Mendoza of the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department, who is conducting the criminal investigation into the incident, shared his thoughts on the matter. \"It's too early to comment on potential charges, but it's clear that this tragedy was avoidable,\" Mendoza said during a press conference. \"We're treating this as a criminal investigation and taking it very seriously.\"\n\nBaldwin and his wife, Hilaria, have attempted to maintain a low profile amid the ongoing investigation, keeping a low public profile and issuing statements through their representatives. The incident occurred when Baldwin was told the gun was a 'cold gun,' indicating it was supposed to be unloaded. However, the gun discharged, fatally wounding Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza.\n\nAssistant director Dave Halls, armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed, and prop master Sarah Zachry have been identified as key figures in the handling of the gun on set.

This spill has resulted in hundreds of affected birds and other wildlife species, including alligators, river otters, nutria, and various bird species.\n\nAccording to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF), more than 100 birds covered in oil have been discovered near the site of the spill. Wildlife officials expect to find more affected wildlife as they continue their investigations.\n\nThe LDWF is working in collaboration with the US Coast Guard, the Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator's Office, and the Phillips 66 team to assess the damage and contain the oil spill.\n\nAffected birds are being captured and transported to rehabilitation centers for cleaning and treatment. The process involves carefully removing the oil from their feathers to prevent further damage.\n\nIn addition to the Phillips 66 spill, the US Coast Guard is investigating 350 reported incidents of oil spills following Hurricane Ida. Crews are conducting hazard assessments to prioritize threats to the environment and navigable waterways.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has received 43 reports of significant inland oil spills and chemical releases after Hurricane Ida. These reports include spills from industrial facilities, storage tanks, and pipelines.\n\nPhillips 66 initially did not respond to requests for comment regarding the oil spill at their refinery. However, they later acknowledged a sheen of unknown origin at the facility.\n\nThe exact quantity of oil spilled has not been officially reported yet. The LDWF and US Coast Guard are working to determine the extent of the damage and contain the spill.\n\nHurricane Ida made landfall on August 29, 2021, as a powerful Category 4 storm. The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to Louisiana, causing widespread flooding and damage to infrastructure.\n\nThe Phillips 66 Alliance Refinery is one of the largest refineries in Louisiana and processes approximately 250,000 barrels of crude oil per day. It is located in Plaquemines Parish, near the Mississippi River.\n\nOil spills can have devastating effects on wildlife. Birds, for example, can suffer from feather damage, loss of insulation, and contamination of their food sources.\n\nThe LDWF is urging the public to report any sightings of oiled wildlife by calling the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Emergency Response Hotline at 1-800-442-2511.\n\nThe oil spill at the Phillips 66 refinery is just one of many environmental challenges facing Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Ida. Flooding, storm surge, and wind damage have affected countless homes and businesses, as well as natural habitats.\n\nThe US Coast Guard and other response teams are working around the clock to assess and mitigate the environmental damage caused by Hurricane Ida. Their efforts include deploying skimming vessels, containment booms, and aircraft to locate and contain oil spills.\n\nThe EPA is coordinating with state and local agencies to provide resources and support for cleaning up inland oil spills and chemical releases. They are also monitoring air quality and providing assistance to affected communities.\n\nHurricane Ida is not the first major storm to impact the Gulf Coast region and cause oil spills. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina resulted in significant damage to offshore drilling platforms and caused numerous oil spills.\n\nThe oil spill at the Phillips 66 refinery is a reminder of the importance of having effective emergency response plans in place to mitigate the environmental impact of natural disasters and industrial accidents.\n\nAs the cleanup efforts continue and the full extent of the damage caused by Hurricane Ida becomes clearer, it is crucial that companies, governments, and communities work together to address the challenges and protect the environment."}

The disruption was due to ongoing efforts to strengthen the system following a cyberattack that caused a week-long outage of the 5,500-mile pipeline, resulting in significant fuel supply disruptions.\n\nThe May 7 ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline system in the United States, led to widespread fuel shortages, with thousands of gas stations in the U.S. Southeast region running dry. The attackers demanded a ransom in exchange for restoring access to the pipeline's IT systems.\n\nColonial Pipeline has been working to normalize fuel deliveries using its shipping nomination system, which is managed by a third-party company, Transport4 (T4). T4 did not comment on the incident. However, the scheduling system was still operating slower than normal, affecting delivery times.\n\nAs of Tuesday, over 10,400 filling stations were still without fuel, an improvement from the peak of over 16,000 stations affected by the disruption. Fuel outages in several states, including North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia, dropped below 50%.\n\nGasBuddy's Patrick De Haan anticipated the number of stations without gasoline to drop below 10,000 by Tuesday, as deliveries resumed and stations restocked. De Haan noted that the situation was improving, but it would still take some time for normal operations to fully resume.\n\nThe cyberattack highlighted the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber threats and the potential consequences of such disruptions. The incident also underscored the importance of robust cybersecurity measures and emergency response plans to minimize the impact of such incidents.\n\nColonial Pipeline has not disclosed the nature of the cyberattack or the identity of the attackers, stating only that they were working with law enforcement and cybersecurity experts to investigate the incident and restore operations. The company has not indicated whether it paid the ransom demand.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have been closely monitoring the situation and providing assistance to Colonial Pipeline and affected states. The Department of Energy has authorized the release of up to 500,000 barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help alleviate supply concerns.\n\nThe fuel shortages caused by the pipeline disruption have led to long lines at gas stations, price gouging, and panic buying. Some motorists have reported paying as much as $10 a gallon for gasoline. The incident has also affected other industries reliant on Colonial Pipeline's products, including the aviation and chemical industries.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline incident is the latest in a series of high-profile cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure, including the SolarWinds hack and the ransomware attack on the JBS meat processing company. These incidents have raised concerns about the security of the U.S. infrastructure and the need for greater investment in cybersecurity measures to protect against such threats."}

The attack killed 13 U.S. troops and over 90 Afghans, marking the group's most globally consequential action to date.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden vowed retribution against ISIS-K following the devastating attack. \"We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nFormed in 2015, ISIS-K rose to prominence as one of the region's most feared terror groups, responsible for the deaths of thousands. The group was ranked the world's fourth deadliest terror organization in 2018 by the Global Terrorism Database.\n\nMembers of ISIS-K primarily operate in central Asia, with an estimated strength now at around 1,500-2,000. The group emerged from Pakistani militants and includes Taliban defectors and veteran jihadists. ISIS-K opposes the Taliban, aiming to establish a caliphate governed by sharia law beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nISIS-K has been responsible for major attacks in Afghanistan, including suicide bombings and assaults on civilians. The group has also targeted U.S. personnel, making them a significant threat to international security. Despite a decrease in strength, ISIS-K remains a significant threat with potential sleeper cells in cities.\n\nU.S. and Afghan forces have targeted ISIS-K in recent years, but the group continues to launch attacks, including attempts on U.S. personnel. In 2019, ISIS-K claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at a wedding ceremony in Nangarhar province, killing more than 60 people.\n\nThe Kabul airport attack was not the first time ISIS-K has targeted U.S. interests. In 2017, the group claimed responsibility for an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, which left at least 13 people dead and over 100 injured.\n\nISIS-K's roots can be traced back to the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a Pakistani militant group that pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2015. The group changed its name to ISIS-Khorasan, or Wilayah Khorasan, to align with ISIS's self-proclaimed caliphate.\n\nISIS-K's ideology is rooted in a radical interpretation of Islam and a desire for regional power. The group sees itself as the true heir to the Islamic caliphate and seeks to expand its influence beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nThe United States and its allies have targeted ISIS-K with airstrikes and ground operations, but the group's decentralized structure and ability to hide in rural areas make it a challenging adversary to defeat.\n\nDespite the challenges, the U.S. and its allies remain committed to disrupting ISIS-K's operations and preventing the group from carrying out further attacks. The Kabul airport bombing serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by ISIS-K and the need for continued vigilance against global terrorism."}

In a recent ABC '20/20' episode titled 'Life on Line: The Last Days of Gabby Petito,' Bethune shared her story of how her discovery led law enforcement to Petito's van.\n\nBethune, who was traveling through the park in August 2021, recorded the footage as part of her YouTube channel, \"JennBethuneTV,\" documenting her adventure. Speaking to ABC News, she shared, \"I was just filming our journey through Grand Teton National Park, going through the campgrounds, and I noticed a van in one of the sites that really stood out to me.\"\n\nThe episode delves deeper into Petito's and Laundrie's last days together, including the discovery of Laundrie's remains in Florida's Carlton Reserve. Jim Winder, the former Moab, Utah, police chief, provided insights into the police body cam footage of the August 12 encounter between Petito and Laundrie at the Moab City Police Department.\n\nWinder commented on the footage, stating, \"I've been a police officer for 34 years, and I've seen a lot of things, a lot of domestic disputes. I've been in situations where it's been really difficult to determine who's telling the truth and who's not. In this situation, it was abundantly clear to me that it was a domestic assault.\"\n\nJason Jensen, a private investigator and co-founder of the Cold Case Coalition, also featured in the episode, analyzed the footage and shared his expertise on body language. He noted, \"There's a lot of inconsistencies between what Gabby was saying and what Brian was saying. And then, when you look at the body language, there's a clear power dynamic at play.\"\n\nThe program further explored the case by featuring interviews with Miranda Baker, who encountered Laundrie at the Moonflower Co-Op in Moab, and Mykel Hawke, a retired special forces veteran and survival expert, who guided viewers through the Carlton Reserve where Laundrie's body was found.\n\nHawke commented on the terrain, saying, \"This is a challenging environment, and it takes a lot of experience and knowledge to survive here. The swampy conditions, combined with the dense vegetation, make it difficult to navigate.\"\n\nThe '20/20' episode called attention to the alarming number of missing persons of color and indigenous women in the same area as Petito. Jensen emphasized the importance of addressing these cases, stating, \"We need to do a better job of bringing attention to these cases, and we need to do a better job of funding and supporting these investigations.\"\n\nAs the investigation into Petito's disappearance and Laundrie's involvement unfolded, many were captivated by the case. Bethune shared her thoughts on the media attention, saying, \"It's important to remember that Gabby was a real person with a family and friends who loved her, and her story deserves to be told.\"\n\nThe 'Life on Line: The Last Days of Gabby Petito' episode not only sheds light on the Petito case but also raises awareness for missing persons and the challenges faced by law enforcement in investigating these cases.\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, please contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or visit their website at www.thehotline.org.

Seven Republicans joined all Democrats in voting to convict Trump, but the tally fell short of the two-thirds majority needed for conviction.\n\nRep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., one of the House managers leading the prosecution, lamented the outcome. \"We proved our case,\" she told reporters after the vote. \"He was impeached by the House of Representatives. He was put on trial in the United States Senate. And he was found not guilty.\"\n\nTrump issued a statement shortly after the vote, declaring, \"This has been yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our Country. No president has ever gone through anything like it.\"\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, however, condemned Trump for his role in the riot. \"There's no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor before the vote. \"The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who watched the proceedings in the Oval Office, emphasized the bipartisan nature of the conviction vote and the importance of defending truth. \"The fact that a majority of the Senate voted to convict former President Trump is a clear sign the American people know right from wrong,\" Biden said in a statement. \"It reinforces why we cannot allow ourselves to be distracted by the baseless lies and destructive rhetoric we've seen over the past few years.\"\n\nThe decision not to call witnesses in the trial was made, in part, to avoid prolonging the proceedings, which could hinder Biden's legislative agenda. House prosecutors described Trump as the \"inciter in chief\" with a months-long campaign of violent rhetoric. But Trump's lawyers argued his words were not intended to incite violence and framed the impeachment as a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nSenators acknowledged the gravity of the riot but were divided on Trump's responsibility and the appropriateness of impeachment. \"I believe the president bears responsibility,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. But John Thune, the second-ranking Republican, said, \"I don't believe what the president did was an impeachable offense.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close ally of Trump's, argued that impeaching a former president was a dangerous precedent. \"I think impeachment was a mistake from the beginning,\" Graham told reporters after the vote. \"I don't think it accomplishes anything, and I think it will further divide the country.\"\n\nThe trial highlighted the fragility of America's democratic traditions and the country's deep divisions. \"The events of January 6th threatened our very system of self-governance,\" Schumer said. \"But the bipartisan vote to convict Donald Trump shows that the Senate, and the country, remain committed to upholding the Constitution.\"\n\nAs the Senate adjourned, the question of whether Trump's actions on Jan. 6 rose to the level of an impeachable offense remained a matter of debate. But the outcome of the trial left no doubt that Trump's words and actions on that day left a deep mark on American history.\n\nIn the words of Rep. Dean, \"We proved our case. We proved it in the House, and we proved it in the Senate. But more than that, we proved it to the American people.\""}

Boyland was among the four civilians who died during the riot.\n\n\"The man that instigated this should be removed from office,\" Cave said. \"He's responsible for this. He's responsible for her death.\"\n\nBoyland's cause of death was not officially disclosed, but a friend, Justin Winchell, told CNN that she was trampled in the crowd.\n\nWinchell, who described Boyland as \"a sweet person,\" added that she had texted him earlier in the day, expressing her excitement about attending the rally.\n\n\"She told me she loved me and she was going to go see Trump speak,\" Winchell told CNN. \"She sounded really excited.

Democratic leaders have called for Trump's removal from office, either through the 25th Amendment or impeachment.\n\nThe White House did not comment on Boyland's death when contacted by Reuters.\n\nBoyland's death was one of several tragedies that unfolded during the riot.

This is a first-person account of my reflections on the wider implications of Donald Trump's behavior towards women, democracy, and one woman's courage to stand up against him.\n\nI have always been fascinated by the human capacity to endure and persevere in the face of adversity. But the story of Jill Harth, a woman who dared to challenge Donald Trump's power and entitlement, is a testament to a different kind of resilience - the courage to speak truth to power. Harth's allegations against Trump are not just a personal grievance; they are a reflection of a deeply troubling pattern of behavior that has far-reaching implications.\n\nIn 1997, Jill Harth, a successful entrepreneur, filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump in the Southern District of New York. She demanded $125 million for sexual harassment, assault, attempted rape, and defamation. Harth's story, which was initially overshadowed by Trump's larger-than-life persona, is a reminder of the emotional and psychological toll that sexual misconduct can have on its victims.\n\nJill Harth was a force to be reckoned with. She had built a successful makeup and skincare business from the ground up, and her personal struggles, including her mother's battle with Parkinson's disease, had only made her more determined. But her journey took an unexpected turn when she crossed paths with Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to Harth's lawsuit, Trump's harassment began in 1992 during a business lunch at Mar-a-Lago. Trump allegedly groped her, made lewd comments, and subjected her to unwanted advances. Harth's interactions with Trump were not isolated incidents; they were part of a pattern of behavior that continued for years.\n\nTrump's alleged refusal to accept rejection is not a new phenomenon. It is a pattern that has played out in his personal and professional life. From his multiple marriages to his business dealings, Trump has consistently shown a disregard for the feelings and boundaries of others. And this disregard has had serious consequences.\n\nThe emotional and psychological impact of Trump's alleged actions on his accusers is something that cannot be quantified. The fear, the humiliation, the shame - these are emotions that stay with a person long after the incident has passed. Harth's courage to come forward and share her story is a testament to the strength and resilience of women who have been subjected to similar treatment.\n\nTrump's refusal to accept rejection is not just a personal failing; it is a threat to the very fabric of our democracy. A man who cannot accept the will of the people, who cannot lose gracefully, is a man who poses a danger to the democratic process. Harth's story is a reminder of the importance of holding those in power accountable for their actions.\n\nAs we continue to grapple with the implications of Trump's presidency, it is essential that we remember the stories of those who have been impacted by his behavior. Jill Harth's story is a testament to the courage and resilience of women who have been subjected to sexual misconduct. It is a reminder of the importance of holding those in power accountable for their actions. And it is a reminder that the fight for justice and equality is far from over."}

The company paid a ransom of 75 bitcoin, valued at approximately $4.4 million, to the hackers to resume operations.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate said the FBI was able to identify and seize 63.7 bitcoins, now valued at $2.3 million, from the hackers. That amounted to 85% of the total ransom paid.\n\n\"We understand that ransomware attacks can have significant consequences on critical infrastructure, and that's why we're using all the tools at our disposal to disrupt these criminal actors,\" Abbate said.\n\nColonial Pipeline President and Chief Executive Joseph Blount called the operation a \"significant milestone.\"\n\n\"Our goal was to disrupt their business model, hold them accountable for their criminal attack, and prevent them from profiting from their attack on Colonial Pipeline,\" Blount said.\n\nActing U.S. Attorney Stephanie Hinds for the Northern District of California, where the seizure was made, praised the collaboration between law enforcement and the private sector.\n\n\"The private sector plays a critical role in cybersecurity, and the Justice Department is committed to working with companies to identify, disrupt, and prosecute cybercriminals,\" Hinds said.\n\nRansomware attacks have been increasing, targeting critical industries globally. The FBI discourages ransom payments but suggests that quick law enforcement engagement can sometimes help recover funds.\n\nMonaco said the operation was a warning to other ransomware groups.\n\n\"Let me be clear: This is not a one-off,\" Monaco said. \"We're going to continue to use every tool at our disposal to disrupt these criminal organizations and bring them to justice.\"\n\nA senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation, said the task force, which was created by a presidential executive order signed by President Joe Biden in May, will continue to pursue other ransomware cases.\n\nThe official added that the U.S. government is working to strengthen cybersecurity defenses and increase information sharing between the public and private sectors.\n\nMonaco encouraged companies to report ransomware attacks to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center.\n\n\"Reporting these attacks is crucial to our ability to respond effectively and hold these criminals accountable,\" Monaco said. \"We are in this together, and we will get through this together.\""}

More than 156 million of these payments have been distributed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as of April 1, 2021.\n\nIf you are among the individuals who have yet to receive their third stimulus check, the IRS's Get My Payment tool can help you determine the status of your payment. The tool can also provide information on when to expect your check if it's still in the mail.\n\nFor those who haven't received their first or second stimulus checks, it's essential to file your 2020 taxes to claim any unpaid funds. Line 30 on Form 1040 (or 1040-SR for seniors) is specifically designated for requesting any unpaid stimulus payments.\n\nThe IRS provides various resources to help taxpayers calculate the amount they are entitled to and claim any unpaid stimulus funds. These resources include worksheets, free tax-filing software, and the Recovery Rebate Credit worksheet.\n\nTo successfully claim unpaid stimulus payments, taxpayers must have an accurate record of the total amount they have received and the amount they are entitled to. This information can typically be found on the Notice 1444 series of notices issued by the IRS for each stimulus payment.\n\nIf there is a discrepancy between the claimed and calculated amounts, the IRS will send a letter notifying the taxpayer of the adjustment. This adjustment could result in a larger tax refund or reduce outstanding IRS bills.\n\nThe deadline to file 2020 taxes and claim unpaid stimulus funds has been extended until May 17, 2021. However, it's essential to file your taxes as soon as possible to receive any potential refunds or avoid penalties.\n\nThe third stimulus check is not taxable for most individuals. However, if you earned more than $80,000 in adjusted gross income (AGI) in 2020 as a single filer or $160,000 as a married filing jointly, a portion of your payment could be considered taxable income.\n\nIf you received unemployment benefits in 2020, up to $10,200 of those benefits are tax-free due to the American Rescue Plan Act. However, this exemption does not apply to any unemployment compensation received after December 31, 2020.\n\nIf you are eligible for the Child Tax Credit, you may receive advance payments starting in July 2021. These payments will be up to $3,600 per child under the age of six and up to $3,000 per child between the ages of six and seventeen.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act also includes provisions to expand the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and the Child Tax Credit for families with older children.\n\nIf you are self-employed, a small business owner, or a freelancer, you may be eligible for various tax credits and incentives under the American Rescue Plan Act. These include the Employee Retention Credit, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan forgiveness, and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act tax credits.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act also includes provisions to extend several tax provisions that expired at the end of 2020, including the Charitable Contributions Deduction, the Exclusion for Employer Provided Student Loan Repayments, and the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief.\n\nThe IRS encourages taxpayers to file their taxes electronically and use direct deposit for the fastest and most secure way to receive any potential refunds. To learn more about the American Rescue Plan Act and its tax implications, visit IRS.gov or consult with a tax professional.\n\nThe IRS is committed to providing taxpayers with the resources and support they need to navigate the complexities of the American Rescue Plan Act and file their taxes accurately and on time.

We've seen state actors not just engage in state activities but monetize those capabilities in the cyber realm.\" The Colonial Pipeline attack, perpetrated by the DarkSide ransomware group, highlighted this trend.\n\nDarkSide disappeared following the high-profile attack, but U.S. intelligence officials suspect the group or its members could reemerge under a new name, emphasizing the ongoing threat posed by cybercriminals harbored by nations like Russia and China.\n\nPresident Biden recently pointed out Russia's lack of action against hacking from its territory but did not directly blame the Russian government for the Colonial Pipeline hack. He added that the upcoming Biden-Putin summit on June 16 would address multiple tensions, including cybersecurity.\n\nLior Div, CEO of cybersecurity firm Cybereason, differentiated DarkSide's capabilities from those of nation-state actors like the SolarWinds hackers: \"DarkSide is a criminal organization, not a state actor. They don't have the same level of resources or capabilities that a state actor would have.\"\n\nMichael Orlando, Acting Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, echoed the urgency of the situation, stating, \"Ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure pose a significant national security threat. These attacks not only disrupt services and cause economic damage, but they can also create opportunities for follow-on actions by nation-state adversaries.\"\n\nOrlando advised against paying ransoms in cyberattacks and emphasized the need for companies to have robust protection and recovery plans. Officials also warned of a growing cyber threat from both nation-state actors and criminal groups, highlighting the need for industry and government collaboration to secure infrastructure.\n\nConcerns were raised that ransomware attacks could potentially preview or test nation-state capabilities in cyber warfare, as the line between criminal and state actors continues to blur.

The royal event, nicknamed the \"eco Oscars,\" has earned comparisons to Meghan and Harry's Sussex Royal Foundation, known for its innovative and high-profile campaigns.\n\nThe shift towards more controversial issues reflects William's growing public stance on environmental concerns. In his opening speech, he stated, \"We are the first generation to feel the effects of climate change, and we are the last generation that can do something about it.\"\n\nThe Earthshot Prize Awards were marked by a green carpet, plant-based canapés, and a performance powered by cyclists.

The disruption lasted nearly six hours, starting around 11:40 a.m. US Eastern time.\n\nThe cause of the outage was traced back to changes made to backbone routers that improperly handled traffic using the Domain Name System (DNS), according to Sarah Aoun, Vice President for Security at the Open Technology Fund. In a statement, she said, \"The Facebook outage was a stark reminder of the importance of a reliable and secure internet infrastructure.\"\n\nFor users in the US, the outage was mainly an inconvenience, but for users in other parts of the world, it represented a significant disruption. In places like Africa and Asia, where Facebook is often seen as synonymous with the internet, the outage was akin to a large infrastructure collapse. In a region like sub-Saharan Africa, where Facebook's internet.org initiative has helped expand internet access without incurring data charges, the impact was particularly felt.\n\nThe outage occurred shortly after a whistleblower interview critical of Facebook aired on CBS's 60 Minutes. Former Facebook employee Frances Haugen testified about the company's failure to address issues like hate speech, misinformation, and mental health concerns. The timing of the outage has fueled speculation about potential retaliation, but no evidence has been presented to support this claim.\n\nFacebook is currently under an antitrust investigation in the US.

The shocking images of insurrectionists storming the halls of our democracy raised serious concerns about the readiness and preparedness of the Capitol Police force.\n\nSteven Sund, the Chief of the Capitol Police, admitted that this attack was unprecedented in his 30-year career. In a statement, he acknowledged, \"Make no mistake, it's my responsibility to secure and protect the Capitol and those who work and visit here.\" Yet, the question remains: Why were they not better prepared?\n\nThe rioters' tactics bore a striking resemblance to those seen in the 2020 riots that swept across multiple U.S. cities. More than 50 police officers were injured during the Capitol riot, and there were fatalities among both officers and rioters. However, it's important to note that the media often portrayed the Antifa and Black Lives Matter protests as peaceful, despite the violent tactics employed.\n\nSund reflected on the Capitol riot, stating, \"We've seen violence at protests this year. We've seen the destruction of property, but we've not seen anything like this at the Capitol.\" This sentiment is shared by many who believe that the perceived lack of repercussions for violent protesters in 2020 may have influenced the actions of the Capitol rioters.\n\nIn response to the chaos, measures are being taken to secure the Capitol for the presidential inauguration. Additional fencing has been installed, and thousands of National Guard troops have been deployed. Sund emphasized the importance of these measures, stating, \"We're going to have a significant law enforcement presence on the Capitol Grounds, and I think that's a necessary step.\"\n\nAs the nation grapples with the fallout from the Capitol riot, there is a call for rioters to be fully prosecuted to prevent recurrence of such violence. Sund emphasized the need for accountability, stating, \"We need to hold people accountable for their actions.\"\n\nFrom a right-leaning perspective, it's clear that leniency toward violent protests in 2020 contributed to the Capitol riot. Those who seek to undermine the rule of law and incite violence must be held accountable for their actions, regardless of their political ideology. It's time to reaffirm our commitment to the principles of democracy and the rule of law that have made America great.\n\nAs we move forward, let us remember the lessons of the past and work together to ensure that the Capitol and our democracy remain secure for generations to come.

Cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure are on the rise, leaving many entities vulnerable.\n\n\"The trend is alarming, and it's not just the energy sector that's at risk,\" Croft cautioned. \"The private ownership of critical infrastructure complicates disclosure and response to cyberattacks. We need better information sharing and improved cyber defenses from both the public and private sectors.\"\n\nThe U.S. government has acknowledged the urgency of the situation. In response, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the FBI have issued joint alerts about the DarkSide ransomware and urged organizations to take steps to protect themselves.\n\nIn 2020, American companies suffered an estimated $20 billion in losses due to ransomware attacks. The most notable attack during that period was the one on SolarWinds, a major technology supplier, which was linked to Russian intelligence.\n\n\"The SolarWinds attack demonstrated that even the most sophisticated organizations can be breached,\" Croft noted. \"The Colonial Pipeline hack underscores the need for a collective effort to fortify our digital defenses.\"\n\nCroft also highlighted the role of cyber insurance in mitigating the financial impact of cyberattacks. \"Cyber insurance can help companies recover from an attack, but it's not a panacea,\" she said. \"Ultimately, the best defense is a robust cybersecurity strategy.\"\n\nAs the Colonial Pipeline gradually resumes operations and the fuel market begins to stabilize, Croft emphasized the importance of learning from this incident and investing in the necessary measures to safeguard our critical infrastructure from future cyberattacks. \"We can't afford to be caught off guard again,\" she concluded."}

Together, we are embarking on a mission to address some of the most pressing issues facing our nation: the lead pipe and paint crisis.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to acknowledge the leadership and accountability that communities have shown in bringing attention to this critical issue. Your voices have been heard loud and clear, and the Biden-Harris Administration stands with you in your pursuit of a healthier and safer future for all Americans.\n\nOur solidarity with the American labor movement runs deep. We believe in the power of organized labor and are committed to being pro-labor. We recognize that the removal of lead pipes and paint is not just a matter of public health, but also an opportunity to create good union jobs.\n\nNow, let me be clear about the gravity of the situation. Lead exposure, particularly to our children, is a danger that we cannot afford to overlook. Lead pipes and paint are still prevalent in far too many homes and communities across the United States, putting the health and future of our children at risk.\n\nThat's why the Biden-Harris Administration has launched the Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan. This ambitious plan aims to accelerate the removal of lead pipes and paint over the next 10 years, with a particular focus on underserved communities. We understand that these communities have been disproportionately affected by this issue, and it is our responsibility to prioritize their needs.\n\nTo make this a reality, we have secured significant funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. $15 billion has been allocated for replacing lead service lines nationwide, and $2.9 billion from this law will be distributed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2022 to states, tribes, and territories for lead service line replacement.\n\nMoreover, funds from the American Rescue Plan can also be used for lead service line replacement, as demonstrated by projects in Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Syracuse, and Duluth. These initiatives are not only making a difference in the lives of countless families, but they are also creating jobs and stimulating economic growth.\n\nSpeaking of jobs, I'd like to emphasize the importance of skilled labor and the training required for the jobs created by these infrastructure projects. At Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 189 in Columbus, Ohio, I had the privilege of witnessing the enthusiasm and skill development for the expected job opportunities firsthand. These are not just jobs; they are careers that offer families stability and the chance to build a better future for themselves and their communities.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to reiterate our commitment to tackling the lead pipe and paint crisis head-on. We will work hand in hand with communities, labor unions, and concerned citizens to ensure that every American has access to clean, safe water. Together, we can create a healthier, safer, and more equitable future for all. Thank you for your unwavering dedication to this cause. Let us continue to work together, united in our pursuit of a better tomorrow."}

However, for those who did not receive their 2020 stimulus checks or are still waiting for their full payment, there are alternative ways to claim the funds through Recovery Rebate Credits by filing their 2020 federal taxes.\n\nThe Recovery Rebate Credits allow eligible individuals to claim the difference between the amount they were supposed to receive and the amount they actually got as a tax credit when they file their 2020 federal income tax return. However, it's essential to note that certain debts, such as child support, back taxes, and other outstanding debts, may reduce your tax return if you receive your stimulus as a Recovery Rebate Credit.\n\nIn a previous relief effort, the December $900 billion Covid relief bill protected the second round of stimulus checks from all creditor garnishment, including private creditors. This measure helped ensure that the payments reached their intended recipients without being seized by creditors.\n\nHowever, tax refunds, including stimulus received as a tax rebate, may still be reduced to pay back various debts through the Treasury Offset Program (TOP). TOP is a federal program used to collect past-due debts owed to the federal government, as well as state and local governments and private entities.\n\nThe IRS will not use stimulus rebates to pay for federal tax debts, but it cannot prevent offsets for state and other federal agency debts. This means that individuals with outstanding state or federal debts may still have their stimulus payments reduced or seized.\n\nThe $1,400 stimulus check under the American Rescue Plan is not subject to garnishment for unpaid federal or state debts but can be for private debts under a court order. This means that individuals who owe money to private creditors, such as student loans, may still have their latest stimulus payment seized.\n\nConsumer advocacy and banking groups are urging Congress to pass legislation to exempt the latest stimulus payments from garnishment, arguing that people should be able to keep the money intended to help them during these challenging economic times.\n\nThe American Bankers Association and Americans for Financial Reform are among the groups advocating for this legislation. The American Bankers Association argues that the government should provide direct relief to those struggling with debts and allow them to use their stimulus checks for essential expenses without fear of seizure.\n\nAmericans for Financial Reform, a consumer advocacy coalition, also supports the exemption of stimulus payments from garnishment, stating that it would help ensure that the funds reach their intended recipients and contribute to the economic recovery.\n\nThe IRS's Get My Payment site can be used to track the status of the third stimulus payment. The site allows eligible individuals to check if their payment has been processed, the payment method, and the expected delivery date.\n\nIt's important to note that the Get My Payment tool only provides information about the status of the third stimulus payment and does not allow users to change their bank account information or delivery method.\n\nTo update bank account information, individuals must use the Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here tool if they are not required to file a tax return. Those who are required to file a tax return should include their bank account information when they file their 2020 federal income tax return.\n\nThe IRS has stated that it will begin issuing payments to eligible individuals who have not received their stimulus checks or Recovery Rebate Credits through direct deposit or a paper check in the coming weeks. The agency encourages those who have not received their payments to file their 2020 federal income tax return as soon as possible to claim any missing stimulus funds.\n\nIn conclusion, the distribution of stimulus checks under the American Rescue Plan is a crucial step in providing financial relief to millions of Americans. However, the possibility of debt reductions and garnishment threatens to undermine the effectiveness of these payments for many recipients.\n\nCongress must act swiftly to pass legislation exempting stimulus payments from garnishment to ensure that the intended recipients can use the funds to meet their essential expenses and contribute to the economic recovery. The American Bankers Association, Americans for Financial Reform, and other consumer advocacy groups are urging lawmakers to address this issue and provide much-needed relief to struggling families."}

The incident, which unfolded over six days, sent shockwaves through the maritime industry and beyond, as the global supply chain faced unprecedented disruptions.\n\nFrançois Mayor, Director of Port Revel, a maritime research and training center in France, explained the gravity of the situation, stating, \"The Ever Given incident highlighted the vulnerability of these vital shipping lanes and the far-reaching consequences of even a temporary closure.\"\n\nInitial reports attributed the mishap to the ship's aggressive maneuvers in response to strong winds and the Suez Canal's shallow and narrow passageways. However, the Egyptian authorities, who oversee the canal, blamed the Ever Given's captain for disregarding their instructions and sailing too quickly, leading to the grounding. Bruno Mercier, a former Marseille pilot with extensive experience navigating large ships through the Suez Canal, refuted these claims, asserting, \"The Suez Canal pilots have full control over a vessel's speed as it transits the canal.\"\n\nAs the world waited with bated breath for the Ever Given to be refloated, marine engineer Julianne Cona documented the incident from her vantage point, snapping a series of photographs that would later go viral on social media. Her images, depicting the behemoth Ever Given wedged between the canal's banks, offered a stark reminder of the precarious balance between man, machine, and nature.\n\nThe Egyptian government's initial response to the incident was to demand a staggering $916.5 million in damages from the Ever Given's owners, Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd. Martin Davies, Head of Tulane University's Maritime Law Center, expressed skepticism over the claim, stating, \"The damages being demanded by Egypt are highly unusual and could set a dangerous precedent in maritime law.\"\n\nThe incident brought renewed attention to the training and handling challenges of large ships in narrow canals. Port Revel, with its state-of-the-art simulation facilities, played a crucial role in shedding light on the factors contributing to the Ever Given's grounding. François Mayor explained, \"Our simulations demonstrated the impact of speed on ship control and the effectiveness of tugboats in managing navigation under strong winds and currents.\"\n\nThe Ever Given's crew, stranded aboard their vessel for an extended period, faced uncertainty and the possibility of charges. Abdulgani Serang, General Secretary of the National Union of Seafarers of India, emphasized the importance of ensuring the welfare of seafarers in such situations, stating, \"Seafarers are often the forgotten heroes in the maritime industry. Their well-being must be prioritized during crises such as these.\"\n\nNegotiations between Egypt and the Ever Given's owners reached a resolution in June 2021, with Egypt reducing its demand to $550 million and an undisclosed settlement being reached after three months. Mercier offered his perspective on the outcome, stating, \"This incident serves as a stark reminder of the complexities of maritime legal disputes and the importance of effective communication and cooperation between all parties involved.\"\n\nThe Ever Given debacle underscored the need for better handling techniques in canals and the complexities of maritime legal disputes. As Mayor reflected, \"The Ever Given incident was a wake-up call for the maritime community. It highlighted the importance of investing in research, training, and innovation to ensure the safety and efficiency of global shipping.\"\n\nAs the maritime industry continues to grapple with the challenges posed by the Ever Given debacle, experts and stakeholders remain committed to learning from the incident and implementing the necessary changes to prevent similar occurrences in the future. In the words of Davies, \"The Ever Given incident may have been a costly and disruptive lesson, but it also presents an opportunity for the maritime community to come together and improve the way we navigate the world's waterways.\""}

The Ever Given, operated by Evergreen Marine, is a colossal vessel measuring 1,312 feet long and 180 feet wide, capable of carrying up to 20,000 containers.\n\nEight tug boats and a digger are currently working around the clock to dislodge the Ever Given and refloat it, but progress has been slow. Social media user Julianne Cona first reported the incident, sharing a photograph on Twitter of the ship wedged sideways in the canal, causing a significant backlog of ships waiting to pass through.\n\nQuote from Julianne Cona: \"I can't believe this is happening. The Suez Canal is completely blocked by this massive container ship. I hope they can get it moving again soon!\"\n\nThe cause of the Ever Given's grounding remains under investigation, but bad weather is believed to have played a role. Mihail Mitev, a spokesperson for vesselfinder.com, a leading maritime data provider, revealed that the ship had charted an unusual course in the Red Sea before getting lodged.\n\nQuote from Mihail Mitev: \"Our tracking data shows the Ever Given deviated from its usual route, making a crude 'S' shape in the Red Sea before entering the Suez Canal. This behavior is highly unusual and may indicate that the vessel encountered adverse weather conditions.\"\n\nThe Ever Given was traveling from China to the Netherlands, making it heavily laden with goods. The disruption to this vital shipping lane could have significant economic consequences, potentially delaying the delivery of essential goods and disrupting global supply chains.\n\nAttempts to get the Ever Given unstuck and traffic flowing again have so far failed, with the latest reports suggesting that the refloating process could take several days. The incident has prompted a significant backlog of ships waiting to pass through the Suez Canal, causing a ripple effect throughout the maritime industry.\n\nThe Suez Canal Authority, the Egyptian agency responsible for managing the waterway, has mobilized its resources to address the situation. However, given the Ever Given's size and the complexities involved in refloating a vessel of this magnitude, the process is expected to be lengthy and challenging.\n\nAs the world waits for the Ever Given to be freed, the incident serves as a reminder of the critical role that the Suez Canal plays in global commerce and the interconnected nature of our globalized economy. The maritime community and shipping industries worldwide are closely monitoring the situation, hoping for a swift resolution to minimize the potential disruption.\n\nQuote from Mihail Mitev: \"The Suez Canal is a vital link in the global maritime network, and any disruption to its operations can have far-reaching consequences.

Circuit Court, Potential Supreme Court Contender\n\nWASHINGTON, June 14 – The U.S. Senate confirmed Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in a 53-44 vote on Monday, with all opposition coming from Republicans and three Republicans joining Democrats. President Joe Biden's nominee, Jackson is the first Black woman to be appointed to this influential court and a potential contender for the Supreme Court.\n\nJackson fills the vacancy left by Attorney General Merrick Garland, a common precursor to a Supreme Court appointment. At 50 years old, she was previously appointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by former President Barack Obama in 2013.\n\nDuring her confirmation hearing, Jackson refuted the idea that race plays a role in her judicial decisions. Democrats currently control the Senate, with a 50-50 split and Vice President Kamala Harris available for tie-breaking votes.\n\nLiberal activists have urged the Supreme Court's oldest liberal justice, Stephen Breyer, to retire while Democrats hold the Senate. Jackson, a Harvard Law School graduate and former clerk for Justice Breyer, is among the front-runners for a Supreme Court nomination should Breyer retire.\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger is also considered a strong contender for a potential Supreme Court nomination. Both Jackson and Kruger have garnered praise for their impressive legal backgrounds and judicial philosophies.\n\nJackson's confirmation marks a significant milestone for diversity on the federal bench. During her confirmation hearing, she shared her personal journey and the importance of representation in the justice system. Jackson's appointment comes at a time when the country is grappling with issues of racial justice and equality.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hailed Jackson's confirmation, stating, \"Judge Jackson's confirmation to the D.C. Circuit is a major step forward in President Biden's efforts to build a federal judiciary that looks like America. Today's vote marks a significant milestone for diversity on the federal bench.\"\n\nRepublican opposition to Jackson's nomination centered around her sentencing record in child pornography cases. However, Democrats argued that her rulings were in line with Supreme Court precedent and the sentencing guidelines.\n\nThe confirmation of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the D.C. Circuit Court solidifies her position as a potential Supreme Court nominee and highlights the importance of diversity in the judiciary. Her appointment comes at a pivotal moment in American history, as the country continues to grapple with issues of racial justice and equality."}

Names like Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, and even Otto Graham are often brought up in this conversation. With Tom Brady's recent seventh Super Bowl win, the discussion has once again gained momentum.\n\nTom Brady's latest triumph in the Super Bowl has strengthened his claim as the greatest quarterback of all time. However, this title is not without competition. The imminent announcement of Peyton Manning's induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame only adds fuel to the ongoing debate.\n\nComparing the statistics of these two legends, Manning had an average season record better than Brady's in terms of completion percentage, passing yards, touchdowns, and passer rating.\n\nDespite this, Manning set major single-season records for both passing yards and touchdown passes. Brady, on the other hand, holds impressive achievements in these categories as well.\n\nIn head-to-head matchups, Brady led with 11 wins to Manning's 6. However, it's important to note that the competition between these two was closer than many fans realize.\n\nWhen it comes to playoff performance, Brady has a marginally better record and playoff passer rating than Manning, as well as significantly more game-winning drives.\n\nBrady's Super Bowl record of 7-3 is a clear advantage compared to Manning's 2-2 record.\n\nManning is often considered to have had to carry a heavier load in terms of team support compared to Brady. However, Manning's teams boasted a slightly better average number of Pro Bowl players.\n\nDespite Manning's impressive single-season records, Brady's closer-than-expected edge along with his Super Bowl victories make a compelling case for the New England Patriots quarterback.\n\nManning's ability to carry a team on his shoulders cannot be overlooked. He led his teams to 11 playoff appearances and two Super Bowl victories during his career.\n\nBrady, on the other hand, has been the driving force behind the New England Patriots' dynasty. He's led them to 17 AFC East titles and 10 Super Bowl appearances.\n\nBoth quarterbacks have had remarkable careers, leaving fans divided on who deserves the title of greatest of all time.\n\nThe debate between Manning and Brady is not just about statistics or records. It's about the intangibles - leadership, poise under pressure, and the ability to elevate those around them.\n\nBrady's impressive playoff record, Super Bowl victories, and clutch performances have given him a slight edge in this debate.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember that both Manning and Brady are among the top quarterbacks of all time. Their legacies will continue to be debated and celebrated for generations to come. Regardless of who gets crowned the greatest, their impact on the game of football is undeniable."}

Maxine Waters' call for protesters to \"get more confrontational\" if former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is acquitted in the killing of George Floyd has ignited a political firestorm.\n\n\"We've got to stay on the street and we've got to get more active, we've got to be more confrontational. We've got to make sure that they know that we mean business,\" Waters said Saturday during a speech in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, where protests have erupted following the police shooting of Daunte Wright.\n\nWaters' remarks drew immediate criticism from Republicans who claimed she was inciting violence, a charge she vehemently denies.\n\n\"Those who engage in violence, looting, or destruction will be dealt with forcefully,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) said in a statement. \"But Maxine Waters' incitement of mob rule in Minneapolis is unacceptable.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-California) announced he is introducing a resolution to censure Waters for her \"dangerous comments,\" saying in a statement she \"has no place in leading our country's Democratic Party.\"\n\nJudge Peter Cahill, presiding over Chauvin's trial, suggested Waters' comments could be grounds for an appeal, saying during a court hearing, \"Those comments I think are inflammatory and could potentially incite acts of violence.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Waters, denying the need for an apology and dismissing claims that Waters incited violence. \"Congresswoman Waters was expressing her deep concern about ensuring justice is served and that peace is maintained,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland) downplayed Waters' remarks but expressed concern over their potential impact on the trial's appeal. \"We don't want anything that we say or do to interfere with the due process of law,\" Hoyer told CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday.\n\nThe controversy over Waters' comments comes as some Republicans have faced criticism for their responses to the Capitol insurrection and previous statements by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia), who has a history of making controversial and incendiary comments.\n\nWhen asked about Greene's remarks, McConnell told reporters last week, \"The House has its own rules. I'd prefer not to get involved in that.\"\n\nGreene herself weighed in on the Waters controversy, tweeting Saturday, \"Maxine Waters is inspiring riots and violence. Dems don't care they're encouraging violence, they're using it as a political tool.\"\n\nWaters clarified her comment about being \"confrontational\" refers to nonviolent actions and speaking up for justice system reform. \"I didn't call for violence,\" she told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\" \"I called for confrontation. Confrontation means to be loud, to tell people they're wrong. It's not physical at all.\"\n\nThe controversy underscores the deeply divided political landscape in the United States, with Democrats and Republicans offering starkly different interpretations of Waters' comments and their implications."}

The jury deliberated for about 10 hours over two days.\n\nBrock Hunter, a criminal defense attorney and past president of the Minnesota Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, noted the significance of the verdict for a nation that has seen numerous high-profile police killings go unpunished. \"This is a major victory for the Black Lives Matter movement and for those who have been advocating for police reform for decades,\" he said.\n\nSenator Tim Scott, the highest-ranking Black Republican in Congress, acknowledged the progress made with Chauvin's conviction but echoed Biden's and Harris' call for more reforms. \"Today's verdict in the death of George Floyd is a step forward, but it is not enough,\" he said in a statement. \"We need real police reform and we need it now.\"\n\nRepresentative Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat, echoed that sentiment. \"The trial of Derek Chauvin has ended, but our work to bring true justice to George Floyd and to combat systemic racism in our criminal justice system is far from over,\" he said.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi also weighed in, saying, \"Justice has been served, but it is far from the end of our work.\"\n\nBiden had earlier expressed hope for \"the right verdict\" while the jury was sequestered, a comment that drew attention. After the verdict, he said he had spoken with Floyd's family to offer comfort and support.\n\nThe aftermath of the verdict remains a challenge for Biden, who aims to address policing racism while maintaining support for law enforcement. \"We need the vast majority of police officers in this country who are good, decent, honorable men and women to understand that we're going to defend them,\" he said. \"But we're also going to hold those few bad apples accountable.\"\n\nReactions to the verdict were mixed, with some expressing relief and a renewed push for policing reform legislation among lawmakers from both parties. Others criticized the verdict as a mere symbolic victory, arguing that more needs to be done to address systemic racism and police brutality.\n\nBiden and Harris urged Americans to continue the fight for justice and equality, warning that the struggle would not be easy. \"This moment calls on all of us to come together, to listen to one another, to understand one another, and to work together to build a future where all of us are treated equally in the eyes of the law,\" Harris said. \"We have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nBiden added, \"We're not going to get it right 100% of the time, but we're going to keep trying.\""}

Cruz-Durbin Showdown in the Senate\n\nSenator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) ignited a contentious debate on Capitol Hill when he proposed an amendment to the American Rescue Plan aimed at preventing illegal immigrants from receiving $1,400 stimulus checks. The amendment met opposition from Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who argued against Cruz's claim, stating, \"There is no provision in the bill that would provide stimulus checks to undocumented individuals.\"\n\nCruz's amendment was based on his concern that individuals without proper documentation, including those who have overstayed visas, could potentially receive stimulus checks due to their possession of Social Security numbers. Cruz emphasized, \"Under current law, individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States but who have a valid Social Security number can indeed receive a stimulus check.\"\n\nDurbin's aide, however, criticized the assumption that all visa overstayers have Social Security numbers eligible for stimulus checks. They highlighted that such conditions applied to previous stimulus packages as well. The American Rescue Plan, however, allows anyone paying taxes in the U.S. as a resident, including non-citizens with Social Security numbers, to be eligible for stimulus payments.\n\nUnauthorized immigrants are defined as foreign-born non-citizens living in the U.S. without legal residence. Visa overstayers retain their Social Security numbers, making them potentially eligible for stimulus checks if they pay taxes. In 2019, there were 676,422 visa overstays, with student visas showing the highest overstay rate, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nA spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed that overstaying a visa technically renders someone illegal. She stated, \"Once a person's authorized period of stay expires, they become an overstay, and that is considered illegal presence in the U.S.\" However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not discriminate based on immigration status when issuing Social Security numbers or taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs) for tax filing purposes.\n\nCruz and Durbin's back-and-forth underscored the complexities of immigration policies and taxation in the U.S. While Cruz's amendment aimed to close a potential loophole, Durbin maintained that the bill's language did not provide stimulus checks to undocumented individuals.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan's eligibility criteria for stimulus payments extend to legal permanent residents and those passing the substantial presence test, making them eligible for the stimulus payment. The substantial presence test determines an individual's tax residency status based on the number of days they spend in the U.S. during a calendar year.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate surrounding Cruz's amendment and the potential eligibility of illegal immigrants for stimulus checks highlights the intricacies of immigration policies and taxation in the U.S. Cruz's concern was valid, as visa overstayers can retain their Social Security numbers and potentially receive stimulus checks if they pay taxes. However, the bill's language did not provide stimulus checks to undocumented individuals, as argued by Durbin. The ongoing dialogue between Cruz and Durbin serves as a reminder of the ongoing discussions surrounding immigration policies and taxation in the U.S.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz (R-Texas): \"Under current law, individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States but who have a valid Social Security number can indeed receive a stimulus check.\"\n\nSenator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.): \"There is no provision in the bill that would provide stimulus checks to undocumented individuals.\"\n\nSpokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection: \"Once a person's authorized period of stay expires, they become an overstay, and that is considered illegal presence in the U.S.\""}

Anna Wintour, the Editor-in-Chief of Vogue, defended the cover, stating, \"We wanted to capture her in a moment of rest and relaxation.\" However, for many, the controversy goes beyond the cover's composition, touching on the racialized and gendered significance of Black women's styling choices.\n\nBlack women in politics constantly navigate complex relationships between their appearance, cultural norms, and Euro-American beauty standards. In an interview with The Root, Dr. Moya Bailey, a scholar of critical race and gender studies, explained, \"Black women's political power and electoral appeal are often tied to Eurocentric norms.\" The controversy surrounding Harris's Vogue cover underscores this issue, as her appearance was subjected to intense scrutiny and comparison to past presidential spouses and first ladies, who are often depicted in more formal, traditional attire.\n\nDespite the criticism, the cover also offered opportunities not available to other Black women candidates. Tyler Mitchell, the first Black photographer for a Vogue cover, captured Harris wearing her own clothes and displaying cultural symbols significant to Black American culture, such as her sorority's colors. In a statement to The New York Times, Mitchell said, \"It's important to recognize that Kamala Harris is not just a political figure, but also a woman of color and an American. I believe that this image represents that.\"\n\nHowever, the cover was also accused of white-washing Harris's skin tone, demonstrating racial bias in photography and the issue of colorism. Black women's bodies have long been politicized in public spheres, with their physical appearance often prioritized over their politics. As Dr. Brittney Cooper, a professor of Women's and Gender Studies and African American Studies at Rutgers University, told NPR, \"We've seen this play out time and time again with Black women in public life, where their bodies become a site of contestation and debate, rather than their ideas and their policy platforms.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the controversy surrounding Vice President Kamala Harris's Vogue cover reveals the complex interplay of representation, respectability, and racism in American politics and media. While the cover offered opportunities to highlight Harris's personal style and cultural significance, it also underscored the ongoing challenges Black women face in navigating Euro-American beauty standards and the politicization of their bodies in the public sphere."}

While the Army Corps levee structure held up against the storm's fury, the city's electrical grid and water management systems crumbled under the pressure. Several electrical transformers blew out, and a key transmission tower collapsed, potentially leaving New Orleans without power for days or even weeks. The city's water pumps were also deprived of power, forcing residents to rely on self-generated electricity and a single turbine, with rainwater continuing to rise.\n\nThe devastating impact of Hurricane Ida on New Orleans highlights the urgent need to rethink our ways of building and living. The climate crisis is no longer a future threat; it's a present reality that demands bold action. However, the principal contributors to this crisis—fossil fuel companies, particularly oil majors—continue to maintain their high status in Louisiana. The intersection of climate disasters and the fossil fuel industry was underscored by Hurricane Ida's earliest landfall at Port Fourchon, a critical marine complex for the nation's oil supply. Moreover, Louisiana remains a stronghold for the petrochemical industry, with an estimated 600 refineries and chemical plants in the area affected by the storm.\n\nAs the local community grapples with the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, it's essential to acknowledge the environmental and health issues related to the density of refineries and chemical plants in the region, often referred to as 'Cancer Alley.' The community's heavy involvement in the fossil fuel industry further complicates the transition to more sustainable practices. This is not a problem unique to Louisiana; similar challenges can be found in communities across the country that have been built around extractive industries. However, it's crucial to recognize the disproportionate impact these industries have on marginalized communities, who bear the brunt of pollution and climate-related hazards.\n\nFossil fuel companies must be held accountable for their role in exacerbating the climate crisis and the resulting disasters. These corporations have profited immensely from the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. The costs of restitution for the damage caused by Hurricane Ida and other climate-related disasters should not fall on the shoulders of taxpayers or the most vulnerable communities. Instead, fossil fuel companies must be compelled to invest in a just transition to renewable energy and pay reparations for the harm they have caused. Only then can we begin to build a more equitable and sustainable future for all."}

For what reason?\"\n\nMany Hazaras feel abandoned as U.S. and NATO troops withdraw from Afghanistan, fearing a return to persecution and increased attacks by extremist groups, including the Taliban and the Islamic State (ISIS).\n\nAccording to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), there has been a significant increase in civilian casualties in the first five months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.\n\nExperts warn that the withdrawal of foreign forces could create instability, allowing groups like the Islamic State to grow stronger. In recent years, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks targeting civilians in western Kabul, home to many Hazaras and Shiites.\n\n\"The situation in Afghanistan is volatile, and the withdrawal of international forces could lead to a power vacuum that could be exploited by extremist groups,\" said Haroun Mir, the director of the Afghan Center for Research and Policy Studies.\n\nDespite the risks, Nekbakht's family is determined to continue educating their children, viewing it as the only path to a better future.\n\n\"We will not let my sister's death be in vain,\" Alizada said. \"We will continue to send our children to school, no matter what.\"\n\nThe intense diplomatic push for a peace deal between the Taliban and the Afghan government has so far been unsuccessful. Ghani's government and the Taliban have failed to reach an agreement on key issues, including power-sharing and the role of women in Afghan society.\n\nMeanwhile, the Taliban have continued to carry out attacks against security forces and civilians. On Tuesday, the group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in the eastern city of Jalalabad that killed at least 12 people.\n\nThe international community, including the United States, has urged the Taliban to engage in peace talks and reduce violence. However, the Taliban have shown little willingness to do so.\n\nAs the situation in Afghanistan deteriorates, many fear that the country could once again become a safe haven for extremist groups, posing a threat not only to the region but to the world.\n\n\"The international community must not turn its back on Afghanistan,\" Mir said. \"The consequences of inaction could be catastrophic.\""}

However, this trend is gradually shifting, with an increasing number of high-profile defendants deciding to take the stand and challenge the prosecution.\n\nChicago-based jury consultant Alan Tuerkheimer explains, \"Social media and the 24-hour news cycle play a significant role in this change. Defendants may feel a need to tell their side of the story, especially if they believe public opinion is swaying against them.\"\n\nTwo high-profile cases that illustrate this trend are those of former Minneapolis police officer Kim Potter and Kyle Rittenhouse. Potter, who was charged with manslaughter in the shooting death of Daunte Wright during a traffic stop, testified in her own defense during her trial in December 2021. Rittenhouse, who is accused of killing two men and wounding another during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 2020, also took the stand during his trial in November 2021. Potter was found guilty, while Rittenhouse was acquitted.\n\nTuerkheimer continues, \"Jurors today are more likely to be exposed to the defendant's narrative through media coverage, and they may have formed strong opinions before the trial even begins. Testifying gives defendants a chance to address these expectations directly.\"\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Phil Turner remains skeptical about a significant shift in lawyers' attitudes towards defendants testifying. \"The decision to testify is a gamble for any defendant. It opens the door to cross-examination, which can potentially lead to damaging admissions or inconsistencies.\"\n\nDespite these risks, recent trials have seen defendants taking the stand. Among them are Jussie Smollett, Travis McMichael, and Elizabeth Holmes. Smollett, a former \"Empire\" actor, testified during his trial on charges that he staged a hate crime against himself in 2019. Observers considered his decision to testify a disaster, as he was found guilty on five of the six counts against him. McMichael, one of the three men charged in the death of Ahmaud Arbery, testified in his own defense during his trial in February 2022. Holmes, the founder of Theranos, testified during her trial on fraud charges in January 2022.\n\nA study published in the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology in 2014 found that 77% of testifying defendants were convicted compared to 72% who did not testify. However, the number of defendants who choose to testify is still relatively small, and studies on defendant testimony are rare.\n\nDefendants with no or minimal criminal records are more likely to testify, potentially due to less risk of exposing a criminal history. Testifying offers a chance to convey one's state of mind, especially crucial in self-defense claims, but comes with risks of cross-examination. Prosecutors may exploit defendants' testimony, looking for inconsistencies or admissions, while not testifying can also be risky, as jurors may fill in the gaps with their own assumptions.\n\nTurner concludes, \"Ultimately, the decision to testify is a strategic one that depends on the specific circumstances of each case. For some defendants, the potential benefits may outweigh the risks. For others, it may be better to let their legal team tell their story.\"\n\nAs the criminal justice system continues to evolve, the trend of defendants testifying in their own trials is likely to remain a topic of interest and debate."}

Chauvin, who was fired from the police department the day after Floyd's death on May 25, 2020, showed no emotion as the judge read out the guilty verdicts.\n\nPhilonise Floyd, George Floyd's younger brother, reacted with tears and relief outside the courtroom. \"I've been waiting for this day for a long time,\" he said. \"It's been a long journey. It's been a tough journey. But God is good.\"\n\nThe conviction of Chauvin, who is white, for the killing of Floyd, a Black man, was hailed as a step towards justice and systemic reform by President Joe Biden and other leaders. \"This verdict sends an essential message: that those who commit violence and abuse are not above the law, and their actions will not be tolerated,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nThe case emphasized the rare occurrence of police officers being convicted for on-duty killings. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, between 2005 and 2019, only about 0.4% of police killings resulted in officers being charged with murder or manslaughter.\n\nFloyd's death led to widespread protests, removal of Confederate statues, and reforms in policing practices across the country. The tragic event also sparked a global conversation about systemic racism and police brutality.\n\nSarah Fitzgerald, a Department of Corrections spokeswoman, confirmed that Chauvin would be taken into custody following the verdict and would be transported to the Ramsey County jail in St. Paul. He faces up to 40 years in prison.\n\nPresident Biden also called on Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which would, among other things, ban chokeholds, create a national police registry, and limit qualified immunity for officers.\n\nTwo witnesses, Janay Henry and Jamee Haggard, testified about the emotional toll Floyd's death had on them and how they begged Chauvin to stop kneeling on Floyd's neck. \"I heard George Floyd cry for his mom. I heard him cry for his dad. I heard him cry for his babies,\" Henry said during her testimony. \"I heard him cry for his life.\"\n\nProsecutors relied heavily on bystander video showing Floyd's final moments, urging the jury to \"Believe your eyes.\" Medical experts testified that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen due to Chauvin's kneeling on his neck for over nine minutes.\n\nChauvin's defense argued his actions were reasonable and Floyd's death was due to health issues and drug use. Chauvin did not testify, and his attorney Eric Nelson did not comment following the verdict.\n\nThe Justice Department announced an investigation into Minneapolis policing practices following the verdict. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represented the Floyd family, called for similar investigations in other cities.\n\nFloyd's death marked a turning point in the national conversation on racial justice and police brutality. While Tuesday's verdict was a significant step towards accountability, it also highlighted the need for continued progress and reform."}

This marked an all-time low for these facilities, offering a glimmer of hope as the country continued to battle the pandemic.\n\nHowever, the tranquility was short-lived. By August 2021, long-term care facilities faced a steep increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths due to the highly contagious Delta variant. Nearly 1,800 COVID-19 deaths were reported in US nursing homes in August 2021, the highest since February 2021, representing a quadrupling of COVID-19 deaths between July and August 2021. Furthermore, COVID-19 cases in nursing homes grew by an astounding 440% during the same period.\n\nThe pandemic has disproportionately impacted older adults and individuals with disabilities, who are more susceptible to severe illness and death from COVID-19. In response to this alarming trend, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) endorsed an extra dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for residents of long-term care settings. Additionally, the Biden administration announced a staff vaccination mandate for nursing homes, requiring all eligible staff to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by September 27, 2021.\n\nAs of mid-September 2021, about 84% of nursing home residents and 64% of nursing home staff were vaccinated against COVID-19. While these numbers represent progress, the ongoing pandemic and the emergence of new variants continue to pose challenges for long-term care facilities and their residents."}

Ramsey, known for his no-nonsense approach to personal finance, argued that such checks are a temporary solution that fails to address the underlying issues plaguing many Americans.\n\n\"If $600 or $1,400 changes your life, you were already screwed,\" Ramsey asserted, emphasizing the importance of long-term financial planning and self-sufficiency. \"People in need of this money have much deeper issues – their careers, their debt, their relationships, their mental health.\"\n\nRamsey, a survivor of personal bankruptcy, shared his own experiences of financial struggle. He underscored the need for individuals to take responsibility for their financial situation, rather than relying on government handouts.\n\n\"I've been broke, and I've been in debt,\" Ramsey said. \"But you know what? I didn't blame the government for it. I didn't blame the economy for it. I didn't blame my boss for it. I blamed me.\"\n\nDespite his commitment to helping people, Ramsey criticized the stimulus checks as political rhetoric. With Congress working to pass another round of $1,400 stimulus checks as part of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue package, Ramsey expressed skepticism regarding its effectiveness.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, has expressed his support for sending $1,400 checks to individuals earning up to $75,000 annually. The push for more stimulus checks comes as many Americans face financial challenges due to the pandemic. Last week, the Labor Department reported 793,000 new jobless claims, bringing the total number of claims since the pandemic began to around 78 million.\n\n\"The pandemic has caused unprecedented economic disruption, and the President believes that getting relief to the American people as quickly as possible is essential,\" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.\n\nHowever, Ramsey believes that the government's focus should be on addressing the root causes of financial instability, rather than providing temporary relief.\n\n\"We need to help people get back to work, pay off their debt, and learn to live within their means,\" Ramsey said. \"That's the only way we can truly make a difference in people's lives.\"\n\nAs the debate over stimulus checks continues, Ramsey remains a vocal critic of what he sees as a short-term solution to a long-term problem.

The New York Congresswoman, a progressive Democrat, described the experience as a \"near-death\" ordeal and revealed that she is a sexual assault survivor, fearing for her safety as rioters stormed the Capitol. However, her account has been met with skepticism and criticism from some quarters, with detractors alleging that she exaggerated her trauma and was not even in the Capitol building during the riot.\n\nRep. Ocasio-Cortez, in an interview with The New York Times published on January 13, 2021, recounted her experience: \"I thought I was going to die,\" she said. \"I felt like I was in a movie I couldn't believe was happening in real life.\"\n\nYet, some critics point out that Ocasio-Cortez was not in the Capitol building during the riot but in the Cannon building, part of the Capitol complex. This fact was brought up by conservative journalist Jack Posobiec, who questioned her account on Twitter.\n\n\"AOC was in the Cannon Building, not the Capitol during the riot,\" Posobiec tweeted on January 11, 2021. \"She's lying.\"\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson also weighed in on the controversy during his show on January 12, 2021, stating, \"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was not at the Capitol during the riot. She was in a different building. She's lying.\"\n\nHowever, Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) came to Ocasio-Cortez's defense, telling MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on January 12, 2021, that the New York Congresswoman had indeed sought refuge in her office during the riot.\n\n\"She came to my office, and there were other members there, and we hunkered down together,\" Porter said. \"We didn't know what was going on outside. We didn't know if it was safe to leave, and we were all just trying to stay safe.\"\n\nDespite these contradictory accounts, Ocasio-Cortez remained steadfast in her claims, emphasizing the proximity and connectedness of her office to the Capitol. In a tweet on January 14, 2021, she wrote, \"It's disturbing that the right-wing media is obsessing over my stories of fear and survival during the Capitol insurrection, trying to discredit my account for political gain. It's disgraceful and they know it.\"\n\nThe controversy sparked hashtags #AOClied and #AlexandriaOcasioSmollett on social media, with some comparing her account to that of Jussie Smollett, the actor who was accused of staging a hate crime against himself in 2019.\n\nOcasio-Cortez addressed these comparisons directly in a tweet on January 15, 2021, writing, \"For anyone equating my experience with Jussie Smollett's hoax, you are missing the entire point. My story is not a hoax. I have nothing to gain from it other than the peace of mind of knowing I did everything I could to protect my community.\"\n\nIn an email to her supporters on January 15, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez asked for help in reporting harassing or threatening posts directed at her on social media.\n\n\"We are experiencing an unprecedented level of harassment and threats online,\" she wrote. \"I want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to keep our community safe and ensure that these threats are reported to the appropriate authorities.\"\n\nRep.

I've said from the beginning that the Capitol was under siege. The Speaker's Lobby door was breached in multiple places.

The issue resurfaced old discussions about whether the government should provide financial assistance to inmates.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans have a shared history of supporting stimulus bills that included payments to prisoners. In 2020, when the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was passed under former President Donald Trump's administration, prisoners received stimulus checks.\n\nSenator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Senator Bill Cassidy (R-La.) introduced an amendment to bar prisoners from receiving the current round of stimulus checks.

Yet, the provision was not included in the final bill.\n\nRepublicans argue that prisoners haven't lost jobs due to the pandemic and thus shouldn't need stimulus money. However, Democrats counter that the eligibility for stimulus payments is broad, requiring citizenship or legal residency and either a tax return filing or completion of an IRS form. Prisoners, who are U.S. citizens, meet these criteria.\n\nCotton's stance on the issue is not new. During the CARES Act debate, he criticized the decision to provide stimulus checks to inmates. \"Prisoners didn't lose their jobs due to COVID-19. They didn't pay taxes. They're not in need of a stimulus check,\" he stated at the time.\n\nIn contrast, Durbin emphasized the potential impact on prisoners' families. \"When we provide financial assistance to the families of prisoners, we help reduce recidivism, strengthen communities, and support the successful reentry of former inmates into society.\"\n\nThe claim that Democrats voted to give stimulus checks to prisoners is rated as 'Mostly True,' acknowledging that Republicans also supported such measures in the past.\n\nAs the American Rescue Plan moves forward, the debate over providing stimulus checks to prisoners is likely to continue, shedding light on the complex tradeoffs in relief legislation."}

I believe that leadership starts at the community level, and it's been inspiring to see so many Texans stepping up to help their neighbors.\"\n\nO'Rourke's volunteer group, Powered by People, has pivoted its focus from voter registration to storm relief, making approximately 900,000 wellness checks and delivering essentials.\n\nO'Rourke was critical of the Texas government's failure to prepare for the winter storms and the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, stating, \"The fact that we were caught off guard by this storm and are still struggling to recover is a clear sign that our leaders have not taken climate change seriously enough. We cannot afford to ignore the warnings any longer.\"\n\nWarnings about Texas' vulnerability to extreme weather events had been ignored by state officials, according to O'Rourke, who added, \"This is a wake-up call for all of us. We need to invest in renewable energy and infrastructure that can withstand the impacts of climate change.\"\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott promised reforms for the ERCOT following the crisis, stating, \"The Electric Reliability Council of Texas must be held accountable for its failure to prepare for this winter storm. I will work with the Texas Legislature to ensure that we never experience a power outage like this again.\"\n\nO'Rourke praised the collective effort from Texans and politicians like U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in providing aid, stating, \"It's been heartening to see so many people from all walks of life coming together to help their neighbors. Politicians like Veronica Escobar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been instrumental in coordinating relief efforts and securing resources for their communities.\"\n\nDespite his frustrations with state leadership, O'Rourke highlighted the positive community response to the crisis, stating, \"The resilience and compassion of the Texas people has been on full display during this crisis. We will get through this together, and I believe that we will come out stronger on the other side.\"\n\nThe storm crisis underscores the need for better preparedness and response to climate change-affected weather events in Texas, as O'Rourke emphasized, \"We cannot afford to wait for the next crisis to strike before we take action.

One such theory, the QAnon movement, which posits a satanic pedophile cabal of Democrats and celebrities, found an unlikely ally in Trump, further eroding his credibility and the faith of many in his ability to lead.\n\nIn an October 2020 town hall with NBC's Savannah Guthrie, Trump was presented with an opportunity to disavow the QAnon conspiracy theory, which gained notoriety for its outlandish claims and baseless accusations against political adversaries. \"Are you willing to condemn white supremacists and militia groups, and tell us that you're not a fan of QAnon and that it's not a good thing?\" Guthrie asked. Trump, ever elusive in the face of uncomfortable questions, replied, \"I know nothing about QAnon. I just know it's a very large thing in the world of potentially truth social media, but I know nothing about it.\"\n\nDespite his denial, it's evident that Trump harbored some level of affinity for the movement. While campaigning for reelection in 2020, he tweeted support for a QAnon supporter, and during a 2018 interview with the New York Post, he praised the movement's \"energy\" and their \"love of country.\"\n\nIn sharp contrast to Trump's ambiguous stance on the matter, QAnon adherents continue to cling to the belief that Trump is on their side, even in the face of numerous disproven claims and theories. \"The storm is coming,\" they proclaim, referring to an imminent \"day of reckoning\" when Trump will supposedly take down his political enemies and expose the elusive pedophile ring.\n\nOne especially bizarre offshoot of this belief system involves the resurrection of the late John F. Kennedy Jr., who died in a plane crash in 1999. According to some QAnon followers, JFK Jr. would miraculously appear in Texas and possibly join forces with Trump in the 2024 presidential race. This fanciful notion only serves to further illustrate the disconnection from reality that characterizes the QAnon movement and its followers.\n\nTrump's critics have long pointed to his baseless accusations against political adversaries and his penchant for spreading conspiratorial narratives as damaging to his presidency and the country at large. In the midst of a global health crisis, Trump's unwillingness to acknowledge the seriousness of COVID-19 and his perpetuation of unfounded theories about the origins of the virus only exacerbated the situation. He even went as far as suggesting that his political enemies were part of a satanic pedophile ring, without any evidence to back up his claims.\n\nDespite Trump's loss in the election, QAnon supporters remain steadfast in their belief that he will eventually be reinstated as president. This unwavering loyalty, fueled by a deep-rooted mistrust of the mainstream media and the political establishment, has created a dangerous environment in which facts are disregarded, and conspiracy theories reign supreme.\n\nIn the face of such disinformation and misinformation, it's crucial that we as a society remain vigilant in our pursuit of truth and evidence-based knowledge. As we move forward, it's essential that we continue to challenge the baseless narratives and conspiracy theories that threaten to undermine the foundations of our democracy. In the words of Savannah Guthrie, \"Are you willing to condemn white supremacists and militia groups, and tell us that you're not a fan of QAnon and that it's not a good thing?\" The answer, for the sake of our country, must be a resounding yes."}

The FBI and NYC's Cyber Command office are currently analyzing the attack, with motives still under investigation.\n\nJohn Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, commented on the situation, \"We're working closely with the Law Department and Cyber Command to assess the situation and determine the extent of the damage. At this point, we don't have enough information to determine if a ransom demand will be made.\"\n\nLaura Feyer, de Blasio's spokeswoman, confirmed the attack in a statement, \"The Law Department's computer system was the target of a cyberattack. The City's Cyber Command and the FBI are working to assess the extent of the damage and restore the system as soon as possible.\"\n\nInvestigators have identified the malware used in the hack, noting it as a familiar strain. The hackers have not yet demanded a ransom, but officials do not rule out the possibility as the investigation continues.\n\nThe Law Department has been using outdated software, including Windows 7 and Microsoft Office 2010, which are no longer supported by Microsoft. Warnings about vulnerabilities in the Law Department's computer systems were previously issued but not adequately addressed.\n\nMiller added, \"Using outdated software is a major vulnerability. It's important for all city agencies to keep their systems updated to protect against these types of attacks.\"\n\nSince the hack, Law Department employees have been unable to access the system remotely or use work emails. Efforts to contain the hack have prevented it from spreading to other systems, but the Law Department's operations have been severely impacted.\n\nAn audit of the Law Department's computer systems was completed last month, but the findings have not been publicly disclosed due to security concerns.\n\nThe incident is part of a wider trend of hack attacks on American infrastructure. According to Miller, \"We've seen a significant increase in cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure in the U.S. and around the world. President Biden is expected to address these issues with Russian President Putin during their upcoming summit.\"\n\nThe NYC Law Department hack is the latest in a series of high-profile cyberattacks on city and state governments in the U.S. In May 2021, the Colonial Pipeline was hit by a ransomware attack, leading to fuel shortages and price hikes in several Eastern states. In March 2021, the Atlanta city government was hit by a ransomware attack, which cost the city over $2.6 million to resolve.\n\nAs the investigation into the NYC Law Department hack continues, officials are urging all city agencies to prioritize cybersecurity and keep their systems updated to protect against similar attacks. Miller emphasized, \"Cybersecurity is a critical issue for all city agencies. We need to be proactive in addressing vulnerabilities and protecting our systems from these types of attacks.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the NYC Law Department's computer system has been down for three days due to a hacking incident. The FBI and Cyber Command are investigating the attack, with motives still under investigation. The hackers have not yet demanded a ransom, but officials do not rule out the possibility. The Law Department has been using outdated software, and warnings about vulnerabilities were previously issued but not adequately addressed. The incident is part of a wider trend of hack attacks on American infrastructure, and President Biden is expected to address these issues with Russian President Putin."}

Elenis: A Preemptive Strike on Marriage Equality?\n\nThe United States Supreme Court is once again delving into the contentious issue of LGBTQ rights, this time in the case of 303 Creative v. Elenis. At the heart of the dispute is Lorie Smith, a website designer in Colorado, who seeks the right to refuse service to LGBTQ customers for same-sex weddings based on First Amendment grounds.\n\nJennifer Pizer, Acting Chief Legal Officer at Lambda Legal, expressed her concerns over the potential implications of a ruling in favor of 303 Creative. \"Allowing a business to discriminate against LGBTQ people under the guise of expressive freedom would open the floodgates to widespread discrimination,\" she warned.\n\nThe parallels to previous cases, such as Masterpiece Cakeshop and Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, are unmistakable. In Masterpiece Cakeshop, a bakery refused to sell a wedding cake to a same-sex couple, leading to a contentious legal battle. In Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, a Catholic foster care agency argued that it should be exempted from placing children with same-sex couples based on religious grounds.\n\nHowever, 303 Creative is unique in that it is not an actual refusal of service but rather a preemptive request for the right to deny services to same-sex couples. Kristen Waggoner, President of Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents 303 Creative, explained, \"Lorie simply wants the freedom to express her beliefs through her creative work, without fear of government punishment.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has opted to focus on the free speech argument, declining to take up the freedom of religion aspect or to reconsider the Smith v. Employment Division precedent. Waggoner argued, \"Creative professionals, like Lorie, deserve the same protections afforded to other artists and speakers.\"\n\nDale Carpenter, a law professor at Southern Methodist University, and Eugene Volokh, a First Amendment legal scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles, have filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of 303 Creative's First Amendment claims for expressive goods and services. Carpenter stated, \"Artists and creators should have the freedom to choose which messages they wish to convey through their work.\"\n\nVolokh added, \"A ruling in favor of 303 Creative would not only protect the rights of designers like Lorie but also set a precedent for other creators and businesses.\"\n\nHowever, critics, including Pizer, warn that a ruling in favor of 303 Creative could legitimize discrimination against LGBTQ individuals under the guise of free speech. \"The Supreme Court must recognize that the First Amendment does not give businesses the right to discriminate against marginalized communities,\" she emphasized.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to let the U.S. solicitor general present arguments on behalf of the Biden administration in this case. The solicitor general's role is to represent the interests of the federal government before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe outcome of 303 Creative v. Elenis remains uncertain, with both sides presenting compelling arguments. What is clear, however, is that this case will have far-reaching implications for the LGBTQ community and the broader issue of nondiscrimination in America.\n\nPizer concluded, \"The Supreme Court has an opportunity to uphold the principle of nondiscrimination and send a message that all people, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, deserve equal respect and dignity under the law.\"\n\nWaggoner countered, \"The Supreme Court also has an opportunity to uphold the First Amendment rights of creative professionals and ensure that they are not forced to express messages that violate their deeply held beliefs.\"\n\nAs the Supreme Court prepares to weigh in on this divisive issue, the eyes of the nation will be on the nine justices, who hold the power to shape the future of LGBTQ rights in America."}

The move signaled the strong ties between Taiwan and the United States, despite China's objections.\n\nThe presence of Hsiao, who has served as Taiwan's representative in Washington since 2016, comes after former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration increased support for Taiwan, including arms sales and visits by senior officials, which angered Beijing. There were concerns in Taiwan that President Biden might not continue the level of support seen under Trump.\n\nEmily Horne, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, sought to alleviate those concerns. \"The commitment of the United States to Taiwan is rock-solid and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability in the Western Pacific,\" Horne said in a statement.\n\nJoanne Ou, spokeswoman for Taiwan's foreign ministry, highlighted the significance of the formal invitation. \"Today marks a historic moment. For the first time in history, a Taiwanese representative has been invited to attend the U.S. presidential inauguration ceremony,\" Ou told Reuters. \"This demonstrates the close friendship based on shared values of democracy, freedom, and human rights.\"\n\nThe United States formally ended diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1979 in favor of China but remains legally bound to assist Taiwan in its defense under the Taiwan Relations Act. Hsiao expressed her honor in representing Taiwan at the inauguration, emphasizing democracy and freedom as common objectives.\n\nTaiwan President Tsai Ing-wen congratulated the U.S. and expressed her hopes for continued cooperation on regional democracy, freedom, peace, and stability. \"I extend my warm congratulations to President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on their inauguration,\" Tsai said in a statement. \"I believe that under your leadership, the U.S. and Taiwan will continue to strengthen our partnership and contribute to regional peace and stability.\"\n\nBiden's nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, expressed favor for greater engagement with Taiwan during his confirmation hearing last month. \"We need to ensure that Taiwan has the capability to defend itself,\" Blinken told lawmakers.\n\nTsai and Blinken met in 2015, indicating a pre-existing relationship between the current administration and Taiwan. Blinken, then deputy national security advisor, met with Tsai when she visited the United States that year.\n\nThe United States has maintained a delicate balance between its unofficial ties with Taiwan and its formal diplomatic relations with China since the normalization of relations between the United States and China in 1979. China considers Taiwan a renegade province and has vowed to bring it under its control, by force if necessary."}

With additional payments on the way, the IRS encourages individuals to use the agency's 'Get My Payment' tool to check the status of their stimulus payment.\n\nThe 'Get My Payment' tool updates once daily, and the IRS advises against calling for payment information to avoid long wait times. However, taxpayers can use the tool to determine if their payment has been sent, and if not, when they might expect it.\n\nThe third round of EIPs is based on either the 2020 or 2019 tax returns, including for non-filers and those who submitted simplified returns. The IRS uses this information to calculate and distribute payments.\n\nIndividuals who previously received stimulus checks via direct deposit but won't this time will receive either a check or a prepaid debit card in the mail. The IRS emphasizes the importance of keeping an eye on mailboxes for these payments.\n\nSocial Security and federal beneficiaries will generally receive their payments the same way as regular benefits, either by direct deposit or check. The IRS has stated that no action is required for these individuals to receive their stimulus payments.\n\nThe stimulus payment amounts to $1,400 for a single person or $2,800 for a married couple, plus $1,400 for each dependent child. This represents a significant increase from previous stimulus payments.\n\nPayments decrease for those earning above $75,000 ($150,000 for couples), phasing out entirely above $80,000 ($160,000 for couples). This means that higher-income individuals will receive smaller or no payments at all.\n\nDue to COVID relief payments and tax refund delays, the IRS has extended the tax filing deadline to May 17, 2021. This extension gives taxpayers an additional two months to file their returns and pay any taxes owed.\n\nTo use the 'Get My Payment' tool, taxpayers must provide their Social Security number, tax ID, date of birth, street address, and ZIP code. This information is necessary for the IRS to verify their identity and determine their payment status.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 also includes provisions for advance Child Tax Credit payments, which will be distributed monthly from July to December 2021. Eligible families will receive up to $300 per child under age 6 and $250 per child ages 6-17.\n\nEligible individuals who don't typically file taxes, such as low-income individuals and those experiencing homelessness, can use the Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here tool on the IRS website to register for stimulus payments and Child Tax Credit payments.\n\nThe IRS urges taxpayers to be cautious of scams related to stimulus payments and Child Tax Credit payments. Scammers may use fake emails, texts, or phone calls to trick individuals into providing sensitive information.\n\nThe IRS emphasizes that it will never contact individuals by email, text, or social media to request personal or financial information. Taxpayers should only provide such information through official IRS channels, such as the 'Get My Payment' tool or the IRS website.\n\nIf taxpayers encounter issues with the 'Get My Payment' tool or have other questions about their stimulus payment or tax refund, they can contact the IRS at 1-800-829-1040. The IRS encourages taxpayers to have their taxpayer identification number, Social Security number, and mailing address on hand when calling.\n\nAs the IRS continues to distribute stimulus payments and process tax refunds, it's important for taxpayers to stay informed and be patient. By using official IRS channels and providing accurate information, individuals can ensure they receive the benefits they're entitled to under the American Rescue Plan."}

Andrew Cuomo remains a political presence in the state.\n\nA state assembly report released in August found \"overwhelming evidence\" that Cuomo engaged in sexual harassment and was not transparent about COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes. However, the disgraced ex-governor maintains his innocence and insists his actions followed ethical norms.\n\nRita Glavin, Cuomo's lawyer, stated, \"Governor Cuomo did nothing wrong. This is old allegations that are a politically motivated attack. The facts will prove that.\"\n\nRich Azzopardi, Cuomo's spokesman, added, \"The governor never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate comments to them, and there is simply no credible evidence to the contrary.\"\n\nState Sen.

It's time for Governor Cuomo to accept responsibility for his actions and step away from New York politics.\"\n\nDespite his political downfall, the future actions and influence of Cuomo in New York politics remain a topic of speculation. New Gov. Kathy Hochul, who assumed office after Cuomo's resignation, is seen as bringing a more collaborative era. However, Cuomo's presence continues to loom over New York politics.\n\nJay Jacobs, New York's state Democratic Party chairman, acknowledged the uncertainty regarding Cuomo's future plans. \"I don't know what Andrew Cuomo's intentions are. He hasn't said anything publicly. But the party will always be open to anyone who wants to run as a Democrat.\"\n\nChris Coffey, a New York political strategist, noted that Cuomo's potential political comeback is fueled by rumors and media speculation, despite his current sidelined status. \"Politicians like Cuomo don't disappear overnight. They have resources, connections, and a proven record of winning. It's too early to write him off completely.\"\n\nMonica Klein, a progressive political consultant, expressed skepticism about the depth of Cuomo's financial resources due to his legal expenses. \"Cuomo's legal bills will be substantial. He'll need significant fundraising to mount a comeback.

In a statement, Glavin called the report \"riddled with errors, inconsistencies, and contradictions.\"\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding Cuomo's future plans has led to widespread speculation about his potential political comeback. Some have suggested he could run for state attorney general, a position he held from 2007 to 2010. Others believe he might try to regain the governorship in 2022 or focus on national politics.\n\nRegardless of his intentions, it's clear that Andrew Cuomo's political career is far from over. The disgraced ex-governor continues to make headlines and shape New York politics, even from the sidelines.

Trump's incendiary rhetoric culminated in a violent assault on the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nThousands of Trump's supporters heeded his call to action, storming the Capitol building during the joint session of Congress to certify the electoral college results. The ensuing chaos disrupted the counting of electoral votes and left five people dead.\n\nBefore the riot, Trump hosted the \"Save America\" rally at the Ellipse, where his allies, including Rudy Giuliani, made inflammatory statements about the election being stolen. Trump's campaign had been spreading false claims of electoral fraud for weeks, encouraging his supporters to gather in Washington D.C. on January 6.\n\nSeveral tweets from Trump in the days leading up to the riot urged his followers to come to Washington D.C. and fight for him. On January 6, Trump repeated his false claims of having won the election and directly invited his supporters to march to the Capitol. In his rally speech, Trump used the word \"peacefully\" only once, amidst several calls to fight.\n\nDuring the Capitol riot, Trump tweeted support for the Capitol Police and asked for peace but continued to push false claims about the election. The president's actions before, during, and after the riot contributed to a violent attempt to overturn the election results.\n\nThe investigation into Trump's potential incitement of the Capitol riot continues. The president has not responded to inquiries from the press regarding his role in the events that transpired on January 6. The House of Representatives impeached Trump for a second time on January 13, charging him with \"incitement of insurrection.\"\n\nAs the nation grapples with the aftermath of the Capitol riot, the implications of Trump's words and actions continue to be felt.

The state's tax agency has already distributed 2.5 million payments worth $1.6 billion from the first round as of early May, with more payments pending.\n\nThe initial stimulus round targeted low-income taxpayers, families with children in CalWORKS, and recipients of certain state benefits.\n\nUndocumented tax filers were eligible for the first round if they met income criteria, with certain adjustments for those making less than $30,000.\n\nThe Golden State Stimulus payments are intended to provide much-needed relief to Californians facing financial challenges due to the ongoing pandemic.\n\n\"California's economic recovery is on the right track, but we must continue to invest in our communities and put money directly into the pockets of our residents,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\nNewsom's proposal comes as the state's economy shows signs of improvement, with the unemployment rate falling below 10% for the first time since the pandemic began.\n\nThe $11.9 billion expansion builds upon the $12 billion relief package passed last year, which included the initial Golden State Stimulus payments.\n\nSenate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins (D-San Diego) and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood) issued a joint statement in support of the proposed expansion, expressing their commitment to passing the legislation.\n\nHowever, some legislators and advocacy groups have criticized the proposal, arguing that it does not go far enough to address the needs of California's most vulnerable residents.\n\nThe expansion of the Golden State Stimulus program remains a contentious issue, but one thing is certain: California's economic recovery continues to be a top priority for state leaders, and the stimulus payments are a crucial part of that effort."}

The increase is being attributed to the highly contagious delta variant, low vaccination rates, and Fourth of July gatherings.\n\n\"The delta variant is spreading very rapidly,\" Dr. Bill Powderly, co-director of the Infectious-Disease Division at Washington University's School of Medicine in St. Louis, told the Associated Press. \"It's more contagious than previous strains, and we're seeing a significant increase in cases as a result.\"\n\nConfirmed infections have climbed to an average of about 23,600 a day, according to the CDC, up from around 11,000 a day at the end of June. However, deaths remain lower than the peak in January, highlighting the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing severe illness and deaths.\n\nAs of July 14, 55.6% of all Americans have received at least one COVID-19 shot, according to the CDC. However, states with lower vaccination rates are seeing bigger jumps in cases. In Mississippi, for example, new cases have risen by more than 50% over the past two weeks, and in Louisiana, they have more than doubled.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of concern in states with lower vaccination rates,\" Dr. James Lawler, leader of the Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, told the Associated Press. \"The delta variant is spreading rapidly there, and we're urging people to get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves and their communities.\"\n\nIn some areas, health authorities are urging even vaccinated people to wear masks again to help prevent the spread of the delta variant. Erik Frederick, chief administrative officer at Mercy Hospital Springfield in Missouri, told the Associated Press that the hospital has seen an increase in COVID-19 patients in recent weeks.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of people coming in who are vaccinated, but they're still getting sick,\" Frederick said. \"We're urging everyone, regardless of their vaccination status, to wear masks in public places and practice social distancing to help prevent the spread of the delta variant.\"\n\nDespite the rise in cases, there is resistance in some states to reintroducing restrictions or preventive measures. In Florida, for example, Gov. Ron DeSantis has refused to issue a statewide mask mandate, despite the surge in cases.\n\n\"We're not going to let fear and hysteria drive our public policy,\" DeSantis told reporters on July 13. \"We're going to focus on what works, and that's getting people vaccinated and protecting the vulnerable.\"\n\nPresident Biden, meanwhile, is boosting vaccination efforts among young people with the help of celebrity Olivia Rodrigo. The pop star, who has a large following on social media, recorded a public service announcement urging young people to get vaccinated.\n\n\"Getting vaccinated is not only going to protect you, but it's going to protect your loved ones, your friends, and your community,\" Rodrigo said in the PSA. \"Let's end this pandemic together.\"\n\nThe White House announced on July 13 that it is shipping an additional 5 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine to states and territories to help boost vaccination rates. The administration is also working to increase the number of vaccination sites and make it easier for people to get vaccinated.\n\n\"We're doing everything we can to get vaccines into the arms of as many people as possible,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on July 13. \"We're urging everyone to get vaccinated as soon as possible to help protect themselves and their communities from the delta variant.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, health experts remain optimistic that the United States can bring the pandemic under control.\n\n\"We've come a long way in the past year and a half, but we're not out of the woods yet,\" Powderly said. \"We need to stay vigilant, get vaccinated, and follow public health guidelines to help prevent the spread of the delta variant and end this pandemic once and for all.\"\n\nLawler agreed.\n\n\"We have the tools we need to end this pandemic,\" Lawler said. \"We just need to use them. Get vaccinated, wear masks, practice social distancing, and avoid large gatherings. It's the only way we're going to get through this.\""}

The incident has sparked a heated debate on the use of live firearms in film production, with many advocating for technological alternatives and improved safety measures.\n\nDirector of Photography Rachel Morrison, who worked on the groundbreaking Marvel film \"Black Panther,\" has been a vocal advocate for the elimination of live ammunition on sets. In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, she shared, \"We have the technology to make movies without endangering lives. It's time to invest in it and require its use.\"\n\nCassian Elwes, a prominent film producer known for his work on \"Lee Daniels' The Butler,\" expressed similar sentiments, stating, \"We can't ignore the risks involved with live ammunition on sets any longer. It's time for a change.\"\n\nJoe Henderson, co-showrunner of Netflix's \"Lucifer,\" agreed, sharing that his production has been relying on airsoft guns and CGI to simulate gunfire for some time. \"Safety is our top priority,\" Henderson stated. \"These technological alternatives not only enhance safety but also meet contemporary expectations of realism in filmmaking.\"\n\nAlexi Hawley, showrunner of ABC's \"The Rookie,\" recently announced that his production has decided to eliminate the use of live weapons on set entirely. \"We can't risk the safety of our cast and crew,\" Hawley explained. \"It's a simple decision when you consider the potential consequences.\"\n\nCalifornia State Senator Dave Cortese has also weighed in on the issue, announcing plans to introduce legislation banning live ammunition and firearms on movie and theatrical production sets. In a statement, Cortese shared, \"It's time for California to lead the way in ensuring the safety of those working in the film industry.\"\n\nThe International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) is also pushing for improved safety measures amid contract negotiations with studios. Dan Frenkel, a cinematographer and armorer, emphasized the importance of following established safety protocols when using real guns on set. \"Banning real guns isn't the answer,\" Frenkel stated. \"But we need to ensure that everyone involved is competent and following proper procedures.\"\n\nGary Truers, an armorer and weapons master who has worked on blockbuster films like \"Jurassic World,\" agreed, stating, \"We have a responsibility to ensure the safety of our cast and crew. That means following established safety protocols and using the right tools for the job.\"\n\nCritics of banning real guns from sets argue that the focus should be on improving safety measures rather than an outright ban. \"Banning guns capable of firing only blanks is a slippery slope,\" shared one armorer. \"We need to trust in the competence of those working on set and the safety protocols in place.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, the momentum towards technological alternatives and improved safety measures continues to grow in the wake of the \"Rust\" tragedy. As the industry grapples with this complex issue, one thing is clear: the safety of cast and crew must remain the top priority."}

The Buccaneers, coming off an 8-9 record, now turn to former Cleveland Browns and Carolina Panthers quarterback Baker Mayfield to lead their offense.\n\nThe Buccaneers have officially handed over the quarterback responsibilities to Mayfield, who signed a one-year deal potentially worth $8.5 million. This move signals a new era for the team as they look to bounce back from a disappointing 2022-23 campaign.\n\nIn addition to the quarterback shakeup, the Buccaneers have made several roster moves during the offseason. Cornerback Jamel Dean and linebacker Lavonte David, both key contributors to the team's defense, have been re-signed. Running back Chase Edmonds, known for his versatility, was also brought in to bolster the team's backfield.\n\nOne of the most anticipated additions to the roster is the selection of Pittsburgh interior defender Calijah Kancey with the 19th overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. Kancey's raw athleticism and impressive college production have Bucs fans excited about his potential impact on the team.\n\nAs the offseason comes to a close, the Buccaneers are set to open their 2023 season on the road against the Minnesota Vikings on Sept. 10. Sportsbooks have set the over/under win total for the Bucs at 6.5.\n\nBetting on NFL games can be an exciting and profitable venture for sports fans. Let's explore the basics of betting on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, including point spreads, over/unders (totals), moneylines, props, and futures.\n\nA point spread is a number set by sportsbooks to give an advantage to one team and a disadvantage to another based on their perceived difference in talent. For example, if the Buccaneers are favored by 3 points against the Vikings, they must win by more than 3 points for a bet on them to pay off.\n\nAn over/under, or total, is the number of points sportsbooks predict will be scored in a game by both teams combined. Betting on the over means you believe more points will be scored than the set total, while betting on the under means you believe fewer points will be scored.\n\nA moneyline bet is a wager on which team will win the game outright. The favored team will have a negative moneyline, while the underdog will have a positive moneyline. For example, if the Buccaneers have a moneyline of -150 and the Vikings have a moneyline of +130, a $150 bet on the Buccaneers would win $100, while a $100 bet on the Vikings would win $130 if they win the game.\n\nPlayer props are individual player performance bets. For example, you could bet on Baker Mayfield to throw for over or under 270.5 passing yards in the Bucs' season opener against the Vikings.\n\nLet's use Baker Mayfield's passing yards as an example. If you believe he will throw for more than 270.5 yards, you would bet the over. If you believe he will throw for fewer yards, you would bet the under. The payout for over or under bets depends on the specific odds set by the sportsbook.\n\nBefore placing any bets, it's important to do your research and shop around for the best odds and sign-up bonuses. Checking sportsbook reviews and comparing their offerings can help you make informed decisions and maximize your potential winnings."}

In an interview on the CBS program \"60 Minutes,\" Haugen revealed her identity, following a series of Wall Street Journal stories that scrutinized Facebook's practices.\n\n\"The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people,\" Haugen said.\n\nFacebook contested Haugen's accusations, with spokesperson Lena Pietsch asserting ongoing improvements in curbing harmful content. \"Despite continuous improvement, we know we have more work to do,\" Pietsch said in a statement. \"We're committed to this work, and it's unfortunate that Ms. Haugen is using anonymous documents to try to paint a false picture of the company.\"\n\nFacebook Vice President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg called the idea that social media caused the January 6 Capitol riot \"ludicrous.\" \"There is no credible evidence to back up the claim that Facebook or any technology platform is responsible for January 6,\" Clegg told CNN.\n\nHaugen claimed that Facebook was aware of its platforms fostering discord and harming teens but prioritized its financial interests. \"Facebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety,\" Haugen said.\n\nThe whistleblower's allegations include Facebook's role in organizing the Capitol riot on January 6 by deactivating safety systems post-election. According to the Wall Street Journal, Facebook executives were informed about potential violent events on the platform but did not take action to prevent them.\n\nIn a statement, Facebook said it had taken steps to prevent violence and that it was cooperating with law enforcement investigations into the Capitol riot.\n\nHaugen's attorney, John Tye of Whistleblower Aid, confirmed sharing internal documents with several state attorneys general and expressed intentions to discuss regulatory actions internationally. \"We're going to work with regulators and lawmakers around the world,\" Tye said. \"The issues that Facebook is dealing with are not unique to the United States.\"\n\nWhistleblower Aid, a nonprofit organization that assists whistleblowers, launched a GoFundMe campaign to support Haugen's legal expenses. \"Frances Haugen is a hero,\" the organization said in a statement. \"She put her career on the line to expose the truth about Facebook's role in spreading misinformation and harming children.\"\n\nThe revelations have put renewed scrutiny on Facebook and the tech industry as a whole, with lawmakers calling for greater regulation and oversight.\n\nSenator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, announced that Haugen would testify at a Senate subcommittee hearing titled \"Protecting Kids Online\" regarding Instagram's impact on teens. \"Ms. Haugen's testimony will provide important insights into Facebook's practices and the impact of social media on children,\" Blackburn said in a statement.\n\nThe controversy comes as Facebook prepares to report its third-quarter earnings on October 26. Investors will be watching closely to see if the allegations have any impact on the company's stock price.\n\nIn the meantime, Haugen's revelations have sent shockwaves through the tech industry and raised questions about the responsibility of social media companies to protect their users from harm.\n\n\"Facebook has the power to make a real difference in the world, but it has to choose to do the right thing,\" Haugen said. \"I hope that by coming forward, I can help bring about that change.\""}

Our nation has faced an unprecedented challenge in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic, and together, we have made great strides in the battle against this invisible enemy. But as we have seen with the emergence of the Delta variant, our work is far from over.\n\nI addressed the nation last week to share the latest developments in our fight against COVID-19 and to outline a new plan to combat this virus and protect the health and safety of the American people. I want to speak to you today not just as your President, but as a fellow citizen who shares in your concerns and your hopes for a brighter future.\n\nThe Delta variant has brought renewed urgency to our efforts to vaccinate as many Americans as possible. It is important to remember that the vaccines are our best defense against this virus. They have been shown to be safe and effective, and they are our ticket back to normalcy. But too many Americans remain unvaccinated, leaving our communities vulnerable to outbreaks and the devastating consequences that come with them.\n\nThat's why I am announcing a new plan to combat COVID-19, a plan that focuses on vaccination mandates for larger employers, increased testing, and school safety measures. I believe that this comprehensive approach is the key to putting an end to this pandemic once and for all.\n\nOne of the most significant components of this plan is the requirement for employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their workforce is fully vaccinated or tested weekly. Major companies like United Airlines, Disney, Tyson Foods, and Fox News have already announced that they will be implementing vaccination requirements, and I believe that this trend will continue as more businesses realize the importance of protecting their employees and their customers.\n\nAnother crucial aspect of this plan is the federal government's commitment to requiring vaccinations for all workers in healthcare facilities that receive Medicare or Medicaid funding. This will impact 17 million healthcare workers and will go a long way in ensuring the safety of our most vulnerable populations.\n\nIn addition to these measures, I will be signing executive orders mandating vaccinations for all federal employees and contractors who do business with the federal government. I believe that it is the responsibility of the federal government to lead by example and to do everything in its power to protect the health and safety of its workforce and the American people.\n\nBut this plan is not just about mandates and requirements. It is also about keeping our schools safe and open. I am calling on governors to require vaccinations for all teachers and staff, and I am committed to providing the resources and support necessary to make this a reality. The safety and well-being of our children should be our top priority, and we cannot afford to let politics stand in the way of that goal.\n\nAnother important component of this plan is an emphasis on increasing testing and making it more accessible and affordable. I understand that testing has been a challenge for many Americans, and I am committed to using every tool at my disposal to address this issue. That's why I will be using the Defense Production Act to boost production of rapid tests, making them more widely available to those who need them.\n\nMy plan also seeks to protect the economic recovery by expanding the COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan program for small businesses. I know that many small businesses have been hit hard by this pandemic, and I am committed to doing everything in my power to help them get back on their feet.\n\nFinally, efforts will continue to improve care for those with COVID-19, including increasing the distribution of monoclonal antibody treatments and ensuring equity in vaccine distribution. We cannot afford to leave anyone behind in our efforts to end this pandemic, and I am committed to ensuring that every American has access to the resources and care they need.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to reiterate my commitment to ending this pandemic and to working with you, the American people, to build a better, stronger, and more resilient nation. Together, we have faced challenges before, and together, we will overcome this one. We will get through this, and we will come out on the other side stronger and more united than ever before.\n\nThank you, and may God bless you all, and may God bless the United States of America."}

In a horrifying turn of events, cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally struck, and director Joel Souza was injured when Baldwin discharged a prop gun. The incident sent shockwaves through Hollywood, revealing a troubling history of carelessness with firearms on the set.\n\nArmorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, a 24-year-old newcomer to the industry, was in charge of the weapons on \"Rust.\" According to a source close to the production, concerns about her carelessness with guns had been raised on a prior film set. In an exclusive interview with The Daily Beast, Gutierrez-Reed acknowledged her inexperience, stating, \"I've been an armorer for a year and a half now. This is one of my first big jobs as a head armorer.\"\n\nAssistant director Dave Halls, who declared the gun \"cold,\" is now deemed partially responsible for not adequately checking the weapon before handing it to Baldwin. Halls told Deadline, \"I don't know what was taken from that cart. I didn't check that cart on my own. I don't handle weapons. I've never touched that gun.\"\n\nMamie Mitchell, the script supervisor on \"Rust,\" shared her concerns with the production team about safety practices and previous gun misfires on the set. According to Mitchell, \"There were two prior incidents involving the misfiring of prop guns on the set. The production team was made aware of these incidents and it was discussed.\"\n\nProp gun safety expert Richard Howell, who works with Foxtrot Productions, emphasized the armorer's responsibility for weapons safety on set. \"The armorer is ultimately responsible for the safety and maintenance of all firearms and pyrotechnics on set,\" Howell explained. \"It's their job to ensure that the weapons are safe, that they're being handled correctly, and that there's a safe distance between the actors and the gun.\"\n\nRust production sources cited the accident as resulting from overall failings, including budget and safety measures. One insider shared, \"There were cost-cutting measures taken that compromised safety. The production company, Rust Movie Productions, LLC, should have prioritized safety over saving a few dollars.\"\n\nThe film's production company, Rust Movie Productions, LLC, has been criticized for these cost-cutting measures. According to IMDbPro, the company's previous productions have had a history of low budgets and quick turnaround times.\n\nHowell continued, \"It's important to remember that accidents can and do happen, but they can be minimized with proper protocols and adherence to safety guidelines. In this case, it appears that those guidelines were not followed, and the consequences were devastating.\"\n\nThe fatal shooting on the set of \"Rust\" serves as a stark reminder of the importance of prioritizing safety in the film industry. As the investigation into the incident continues, the industry awaits answers and the implementation of new safety measures to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.\n\nGutierrez-Reed's statement in full: \"I've been an armorer for a year and a half now. This is one of my first big jobs as a head armorer. I was hired by the production company to do the job and I took it very seriously. I've worked under experienced armors and I've trained under them. I was following the procedures I was taught and it still went wrong.\"\n\nHalls' statement in full: \"I don't know what was taken from that cart. I didn't check that cart on my own.

The incident provided a reprieve to the oil market, which had been experiencing a downturn in recent days, with prices dropping to their lowest since early February.\n\nAccording to Will Sungchil Yun, Senior Commodities Analyst at VI Investment Corp., \"The Suez Canal disruption is a bullish factor for oil prices in the short term as it disrupts around 4% of the world's daily oil flows, especially for Mediterranean crudes.\"\n\nOil futures in New York increased by nearly 1% in response to the incident, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settling at $59.84 a barrel, up from $59.17 the previous day.\n\nHowever, oil prices have fallen more than 12% in less than two weeks, influenced by softening physical demand and the unwinding of long positions. The prompt timespread for global Brent crude has entered a bearish structure, indicating near-dated contracts are cheaper than later-dated ones.\n\nWarren Patterson, Head of Commodities Strategy at ING Group, noted, \"The Suez Canal disruption could lead to a tightening of supply for a short period, but it's unclear how long the disruption will last, and how much of a dent it will put in the global oil supply.\"\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. crude inventories reportedly rose by almost 3 million barrels last week, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute, further adding pressure to the oil market.\n\nThe blockage of the Suez Canal by the Ever Given ship has caused a gridlock of at least 100 vessels, resulting in a slowdown of global commerce. However, any disruption is expected to be temporary as efforts are underway to refloat the ship.\n\nApproximately 10% of total seaborne oil trade goes through the Suez Canal, but any disruption is expected to be temporary. The International Energy Agency (IEA) stated that the impact on global oil markets should be \"limited and short-lived.\"\n\nDespite the recent decline, crude prices are still up almost 20% this year, with expectations that fuel consumption will increase as COVID-19 vaccinations accelerate and economies reopen.\n\nOPEC+ may face pressure to address the recent plunge in oil prices at their next meeting, scheduled for April 1. The group has been implementing production cuts to stabilize the market, but recent price volatility may prompt calls for action.\n\nIn the words of Yun, \"OPEC+ could consider extending production cuts or even deeper cuts if the situation warrants it. However, it's important to keep in mind that the disruption in the Suez Canal is just a short-term factor. The longer-term outlook for oil remains bearish due to weakening demand.\"\n\nThe Suez Canal crisis has highlighted the vulnerability of global oil trade to disruptions, emphasizing the need for diversification and resilience in the energy sector. While the short-term impact on oil prices may be significant, the longer-term outlook remains uncertain."}

Her comments come after the rioting at the U.S. Capitol last week, which left several people dead and was widely condemned.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that Trump is currently blocked from posting to Facebook and Instagram \"indefinitely.\" However, Obama was not satisfied with this measure. In a statement, she criticized Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for not doing enough to stop extremist content from Trump and his supporters.\n\n\"Social media companies must do more to protect their users from this kind of poison,\" Obama said in a statement. \"They have a social responsibility to their users. It's time for these companies to take a stand and ban Donald Trump permanently from their platforms.\"\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, echoed Obama's sentiments. \"Freedom of expression does not give anyone the right to incite violence,\" Greenblatt said in an interview with USA TODAY. \"Social media companies have a responsibility to keep their platforms safe from hate speech and incitement to violence.\"\n\nRep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, also called for permanent bans on Trump's social media accounts. \"Facebook and Twitter should have acted sooner to prevent the spread of misinformation and incitement to violence,\" Thompson said in a statement. \"But it's not too late for them to do the right thing and permanently ban Donald Trump from their platforms.\"\n\nSarah Kate Ellis, President and CEO of GLAAD, urged Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to take similar action. \"Twitter's continued failure to take action against Donald Trump puts people's lives at risk,\" Ellis said in a statement. \"It's time for Twitter to ban Donald Trump to protect its users from further danger.\"\n\nDespite these calls, Silicon Valley has been resistant to banning Trump, even amidst claims of voter fraud. Twitter temporarily suspended Trump's account following the Capitol riot but later restored it with a warning label. Facebook suspended Trump's account indefinitely, but it's unclear when or if he will be allowed back.\n\nTrump's ban from Facebook and Twitter came after the Capitol riot, which was fueled in part by false claims of election fraud spread on social media. The violence at the Capitol resulted in the deaths of five people, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nGreenblatt placed blame on both Trump and the tech companies for the Capitol violence. \"The President's words have consequences, and social media companies have a responsibility to prevent their platforms from being used to incite violence,\" Greenblatt said.\n\nThompson also criticized Facebook and Twitter for only acting after significant violence occurred. \"These companies have known for months that Donald Trump was using their platforms to spread misinformation and incite violence,\" Thompson said. \"They had a duty to act sooner to prevent the violence we saw at the Capitol.\"\n\nObama's call for a permanent ban on Trump's social media accounts is just the latest in a growing chorus of voices demanding action from tech companies. It remains to be seen whether Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube will heed these calls and take more decisive action against Trump and his supporters.\n\nMichelle Obama: \"Social media companies must do more to protect their users from this kind of poison.\"\n\nMark Zuckerberg: \"Donald Trump is currently blocked from posting to Facebook and Instagram indefinitely.\"\n\nJonathan Greenblatt: \"Freedom of expression does not give anyone the right to incite violence.\"\n\nRep.

Pelosi made the announcement during a press conference, stating, \"The American people deserve the truth.\"\n\nThe proposed commission comes after former President Donald Trump's acquittal in his second Senate impeachment trial. Senate hearings into the riot are already scheduled, with Pelosi having appointed retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré to review Capitol security processes.\n\n\"We can't allow this to happen again,\" Pelosi said. \"We have a responsibility to seek the truth, to seek the facts, to protect the American people, to protect the Congress, to protect the Capitol.\"\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) expressed bipartisan support for a comprehensive investigation, saying, \"We need a full accounting of what happened before, during, and after the attack on the Capitol.\" Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) echoed this sentiment, adding, \"We need to know how this happened and how we can prevent it from happening again.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), however, expressed concerns about the potential politicization of an independent commission, stating, \"The last thing we need is another partisan investigation.\" Graham instead called for a bipartisan select committee in the House.\n\nDemocratic Del. Stacey Plaskett, who served as a House prosecutor during Trump's impeachment trial, emphasized the importance of accountability, saying, \"We cannot allow the perpetrators of this heinous attack to go unanswered. We owe it to the American people to get to the bottom of this.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has yet to comment on Pelosi's proposal. However, during Trump's trial, he acknowledged the gravity of the events, stating, \"The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the President and other powerful people.\"\n\nRep. Madeleine Dean (D-PA), a member of the House Select Committee on the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, emphasized the need for a systemic review, stating, \"We need to safeguard our democratic process. We need to make sure that this can never happen again.\"\n\nAn independent commission would likely require legislation to create, raising concerns about possible partisan divisions and impacts on President Biden's agenda. Senators from both parties have expressed the need for a complete investigation to prevent future incidents and ensure the security of the Capitol and the democratic process.\n\nThe Senate acquitted Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\" with a bipartisan vote of 57-43. However, Trump remains a divisive figure within the GOP, with some continuing to support him and others distancing themselves from his actions on January 6. Discussions continue regarding the accountability and future role of Trump and the need for a systemic review to safeguard the democratic process."}

Miller, who was wearing a T-shirt with the phrases 'Take America Back' and 'I Was There, Washington D.C., January 6, 2021,' at the time of his arrest, now faces 12 charges, including civil disorder and assaulting officers, following a grand jury indictment on February 12.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint, Miller documented his actions during the Capitol siege on social media, admitting to entering the Capitol building. Prosecutors have requested that Miller remain jailed while awaiting trial due to the incriminating nature of his T-shirt and social media posts.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Jason McCullough stated during a detention hearing on February 23, \"The defendant, on January 6, 2021, was in Washington, D.C., to engage in an insurrection, to overthrow the government, and to stop the certification of electoral votes.\"\n\nIn one social media post, Miller allegedly made threatening statements towards Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a Capitol police officer. \"We're going to hang her [Ocasio-Cortez] with the same [expletive] rope she wants to hang us with,\" the post read. Regarding the Capitol officer, Miller wrote, \"I wish someone had a gun and shot the [expletive] already.\"\n\nMiller is also accused of wanting to disrupt the democratic process by bringing tactical gear, ropes, and a gun to the Capitol. \"He came to D.C. with the intent to engage in a violent insurrection,\" McCullough said.\n\nF. Clinton Broden, Miller's defense attorney, argued for his client's release during the detention hearing, stating, \"He is not a flight risk, and he's not a danger to the community. He has no criminal history.\" Broden also noted that Miller expressed regret for his actions.\n\nDespite Broden's request, U.S. Magistrate Judge D. Michael Lynn agreed with prosecutors, citing the seriousness of the charges and Miller's threat to public safety.\n\nMiller currently remains in jail in Oklahoma City due to an injury, which has delayed his transport to Washington for trial.\n\n\"The defendant was not just an observer on January 6; he was an active participant,\" McCullough emphasized during the hearing.\n\nAccording to federal investigators, Miller was part of a large group of rioters who entered the Capitol building through a broken window. He was seen on surveillance footage wearing a helmet and carrying a tactical vest inside the Capitol.\n\nIn another social media post, Miller bragged about his actions, stating, \"I went to the Capitol. I broke in and made it inside. It was awesome!\"\n\nMiller's actions on January 6, 2021, contributed to the disruption of the democratic process by preventing Congress from certifying the electoral college vote for President Joe Biden. The Capitol riots resulted in the deaths of five people, including a Capitol police officer.\n\nAs the investigation into the Capitol riots continues, more individuals are being charged and brought to justice for their roles in the insurrection. The legal proceedings serve as a reminder of the importance of upholding the democratic process and respecting the rule of law."}

This authorization covers individuals not currently infected with SARS-CoV-2, not recently exposed to it, and either immunocompromised or having a history of severe adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nPatrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., Acting FDA Commissioner and Director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, emphasized the importance of COVID-19 vaccines for the majority of the population. \"Vaccines continue to be the best way to prevent COVID-19,\" she stated. \"However, we recognize that vaccines are not an option for some individuals, and today's action provides an additional tool to help prevent infection in these individuals.\"\n\nEvusheld consists of a combination of two long-acting monoclonal antibodies, tixagevimab and cilgavimab, which are designed to block the virus by targeting the spike protein. The treatment is administered via two consecutive intramuscular injections and is intended for a six-month efficacy period. It is not a substitute for COVID-19 vaccines and should only be used in individuals who do not have access to or cannot receive COVID-19 vaccines and meet the specified criteria.\n\nDr. Cavazzoni continued, \"Today's authorization provides an important alternative for individuals who cannot receive a COVID-19 vaccine due to a medical condition or a history of severe adverse reactions and are at high risk for infection. We will continue to evaluate data as it becomes available to support the use of COVID-19 therapeutics.\"\n\nThe primary data for the EUA comes from the PROVENT clinical trial, which showed a 77% reduced risk of developing COVID-19 for Evusheld recipients over those receiving a placebo. The most common side effects of Evusheld include hypersensitivity reactions, bleeding at the injection site, headache, fatigue, cough, and, in rare cases, serious cardiac adverse events.\n\nDr. Cavazzoni emphasized the importance of continuing to monitor the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 therapeutics. \"The FDA remains committed to ensuring that Americans have access to safe and effective COVID-19 treatments, vaccines, and prevention options, and we will continue to work closely with sponsors to expedite the development and review of these critical products,\" she said.\n\nThe FDA encourages healthcare professionals and patients to report any adverse events related to Evusheld or any other COVID-19 product to the FDA's MedWatch Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program.

The outage, which affected millions of users worldwide, left many wondering about the resilience of the social media giant's infrastructure.\n\nAccording to early reports, the outage was caused by a configuration change to the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between Facebook's data centers. Cloudflare, a leading cloud security and DNS provider, later provided a detailed explanation of the incident.\n\nCloudflare's analysis revealed that the outage involved DNS (Domain Name System) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), two crucial components for internet connectivity. DNS translates domain names into IP addresses, while BGP helps direct traffic between different networks.\n\nThe disruption brought all Facebook services to a standstill, affecting both public-facing platforms and internal systems. This resulted in staff being locked out of offices and unable to use the internal communications platform, causing further complications in resolving the issue.\n\nSince the internal systems were down, it took a considerable amount of time for Facebook's technical team to diagnose and resolve the problem. The drawn-out process was due, in part, to the inability to access crucial data and tools required for effective troubleshooting.\n\nFacebook eventually indicated that the fix was slow due to the need to bring systems back to full capacity carefully. A technical team had to manually reset servers in California where the problem originated to ensure a stable recovery.\n\nSuch outages, while uncommon, highlight the issues with a single point of failure for online services. The incident underscores the importance of distributed systems, redundancy, and resilience to prevent prolonged service disruptions.\n\nThe outage occurred during a particularly challenging time for Facebook. Plans for an Instagram for kids had recently been paused due to concerns over privacy and child safety, while whistleblower allegations regarding the company's handling of user data continued to mount.\n\nThe timing of the outage could not have come at a worse moment for Facebook. The company's share price dropped 4.9% as a result of the incident, reducing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's personal wealth by an estimated $6 billion.\n\nThe impact of the outage was far-reaching, affecting both individual users and businesses that rely on Facebook's platforms for marketing and communication. Many businesses reported lost revenue due to the extended downtime.\n\nThe outage also raised questions about Facebook's commitment to transparency and accountability. Some critics suggested that the lack of clear communication during the incident underscored the need for greater oversight and regulation of tech companies.\n\nFacebook's initial response to the outage was met with frustration from users who were unable to access their accounts or communicate with friends and family. Many took to alternative platforms, such as Twitter, to voice their concerns and share their experiences.\n\nAs the outage wore on, Facebook's technical team worked tirelessly to identify and resolve the root cause of the issue. They provided regular updates on their progress and assured users that they were doing everything in their power to restore services as soon as possible.\n\nThe outage eventually came to an end, with Facebook announcing that services had been fully restored. The company expressed its apologies for the inconvenience caused and pledged to learn from the incident to prevent similar occurrences in the future.\n\nIn the aftermath of the outage, experts weighed in on the implications for Facebook and the tech industry as a whole. Some suggested that the incident could lead to increased scrutiny of tech companies and their infrastructure, while others saw it as an opportunity for Facebook to demonstrate its commitment to resilience and reliability.\n\nAs the dust settles on the six-hour Facebook outage, one thing is clear: the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of robust, distributed systems and the need for continuous improvement in the face of ever-evolving technological challenges."}

The failure of Operation Eagle Claw led Marcinko to form the dedicated counter-terrorist unit, SEAL Team 6.\n\nRetired Navy SEAL Adm. Eric Olson described Marcinko as \"imaginative, bold, and a warrior at heart.\" Olson, who served as the head of U.S. Special Operations Command from 2009 to 2011, added, \"His contributions to the Navy SEALs and his innovative leadership of SEAL Team 6 left a lasting legacy.\"\n\nAfter retiring in 1989, Marcinko became a best-selling author with books such as Rogue Warrior, which chronicled the adventures of a fictional character named Marcinko. The books' success solidified his status as a pop culture icon and a household name.\n\nMarcinko's impact on the military world extended beyond his time with SEAL Team 6. He was a key figure in the development of the Navy's Maritime Special Purpose Force (MSPF), a precursor to today's Naval Special Warfare Development Group (NSWDG), also known as DEVGRU or SEAL Team 6.\n\n\"My father was a pioneer in the special operations community,\" Matthew Marcinko told PEOPLE in a statement. \"He was a visionary, a trailblazer, and a true American hero. His legacy will live on through the countless lives he touched and inspired.\"\n\nMarcinko's leadership style was unconventional, to say the least. He famously led his team through a grueling 120-mile ruck march along the Appalachian Trail to test their resolve and endurance. The team was required to carry all their equipment, and only the strongest survived.\n\nThe training regimen paid off in 2011 when SEAL Team 6, under the command of Adm. William McRaven, carried out the successful raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. Marcinko's innovative training methods laid the groundwork for the team's success.\n\nMarcinko's military career was not without controversy. He was court-martialed in 1983 for insubordination and was later given a general discharge. However, his achievements far outweighed the controversy, and he remained a revered figure in the special operations community.\n\nMarcinko's passing leaves a void in the military community and beyond. His legacy as a pioneer, innovator, and American hero will continue to inspire generations to come.\n\nIn closing, Adm. Olson said, \"Dick Marcinko was more than just a military legend. He was a father, a husband, and a friend to many. His impact on the Navy SEALs and the special operations community will never be forgotten. Rest in peace, Rogue Warrior.\""}

In 2015, TV Land and Warner Bros. ceased reruns of the show and stopped production of General Lee toy cars due to the flag's controversial symbolism.\n\nSchneider defended the General Lee in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, stating, \"The General Lee never caused any issues with African American fans.

According to Rabie, \"These improvements will not only enhance the canal's capacity to accommodate larger vessels but also reduce the risk of future groundings and blockages.\"\n\nWhile organizations cannot entirely prevent crises, they can learn from past experiences and implement reforms to prevent recurrence. For instance, Starbucks responded to a racial bias incident by conducting anti-bias training for its employees.\n\nIn an interview with Forbes, Jonathan Wackrow, a former agent with the U.S. Secret Service, shared insights into how organizations can learn from past crises. \"The key is to conduct comprehensive after-action reviews and use those learnings to make necessary improvements,\" said Wackrow.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service has faced criticism for a perceived lack of transparency and accountability in crisis situations. In response, the agency has highlighted organizational and policy changes made in response to past incidents.\n\n\"We understand the importance of transparency and accountability in crisis situations,\" said Wackrow. \"That's why we've made significant improvements in communication, budget articulation, hiring, and training.\"\n\nAn independent review following a White House fence-jumping incident led to 19 recommendations for the Secret Service. \"We've implemented every single one of those recommendations,\" added Wackrow.\n\nAfter a crisis, debriefing is crucial, but it needs clear leadership support and understanding of its purpose. Brian Glicklich, CEO of Digital Strategies, emphasized the importance of effective crisis management.\n\n\"Leaders must recognize that a crisis is an opportunity to learn and improve,\" said Glicklich. \"They need to set the tone for a thorough, unbiased analysis of what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening again.\"\n\nRabie agreed, stating, \"The Suez Canal blockage was a wake-up call for us. We cannot afford to wait for another incident to occur before taking action.\"\n\nWackrow added, \"At the Secret Service, we've learned that the key to effective crisis management is being proactive, transparent, and accountable.\"\n\nThe SCA's expansion project is a prime example of proactive crisis management. By widening and deepening the canal, the organization is taking steps to prevent future blockages.\n\nHowever, not all organizations respond to crises in such a manner. In some cases, the response can worsen the situation, leading to long-term damage to the organization's reputation.\n\nForbes reached out to several organizations that had experienced crises in the past to understand their response strategies. While some had adopted a proactive approach, others had been criticized for their lackluster response.\n\nOne such organization was Boeing, which faced criticism following the 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019. \"Boeing's initial response was to downplay the severity of the situation and focus on maintaining profits,\" said a source close to the investigation. \"This approach only worsened the crisis and led to increased scrutiny and fines.\"\n\nIn contrast, Johnson & Johnson's response to the Tylenol poisoning crisis in 1982 is often cited as a textbook example of effective crisis management. \"Johnson & Johnson was transparent about the issue, recalled the product, and implemented new safety measures to prevent a recurrence,\" said Glicklich.\n\nWackrow emphasized the importance of communication in crisis management. \"Being open and transparent about the situation is crucial,\" he said. \"It not only builds trust with stakeholders but also allows the organization to address any misinformation that may be circulating.\"\n\nRabie agreed, stating, \"Communication is key in any crisis situation. We've learned that keeping stakeholders informed about the situation and the steps we're taking to address it is essential.\"\n\nGlicklich added, \"Effective crisis management is about more than just putting out fires. It's about learning from the situation, making necessary improvements, and communicating those changes to stakeholders.\"\n\nWackrow concluded, \"At the end of the day, crises are a part of doing business. But how an organization responds to a crisis can make all the difference in its long-term success.\"\n\nRabie echoed Wackrow's sentiments, stating, \"The Suez Canal blockage was a challenging time for us, but it also presented an opportunity for growth and improvement. We're committed to learning from the experience and making the necessary changes to prevent a recurrence.\""}

Emphasizing the importance of global cooperation, the President expressed his belief that the fastest way to save lives and restore economies is by ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nTo support this goal, the U.S. has pledged $4 billion to COVAX, the global vaccine distribution initiative, and is working to increase global vaccine production. The President also supports temporarily waiving intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines through the World Trade Organization to expedite the manufacturing and distribution of vaccines worldwide.\n\nThe U.S. has already started sharing its vaccine surplus with neighboring countries and strategic partners. More than 4 million doses have been sent to Canada and Mexico, and an additional 80 million doses will be distributed globally by the end of June. Of these, the first 25 million doses will be allocated through COVAX, with at least 75% going to countries in greatest need. An estimated 19 million doses will be distributed to Latin America, the Caribbean, South and Southeast Asia, and Africa, while over 6 million doses will be shared directly with countries in need, including India, the Republic of Korea, and others.\n\nThe Biden administration's goal is to save lives and end the pandemic without expecting favors or concessions in return. The U.S. understands that strong American leadership is essential for improving global health security and addressing pressing global challenges. Future vaccine distribution plans will be announced as the U.S. continues to combat the spread of COVID-19 at home and works in partnership with the international community to ensure a more equitable and effective response to this global health crisis."}

The bombing was claimed by IS, also known as Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-K).\n\nNavy Capt. William Urban, spokesman for U.S. Central Command, confirmed the drone strike in a statement, revealing that one individual was killed, and no civilian casualties were reported. \"At approximately 6:45 p.m. EDT, Aug. 29, U.S. military forces conducted a self-defense unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) strike against an IS-K planner in the Nangahar Province of Afghanistan,\" Urban stated.\n\nMaj. Gen. Hank Taylor, the Pentagon's Joint Staff director, told reporters during a briefing that President Joe Biden authorized the drone strike and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered it. \"The president has made clear that any attack on our forces or on those who are helping our forces will be met with a swift and effective response,\" Taylor said.\n\nIt is not yet confirmed if the targeted individual was directly involved in the Kabul airport suicide bombing, but U.S. officials believe he was planning future attacks against U.S. personnel in the area.\n\nThe drone strike was executed using an MQ-9 Reaper drone, a remotely piloted aircraft commonly employed for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. By utilizing an unmanned vehicle, the U.S. military aimed to minimize potential civilian casualties.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kabul issued a security alert advising U.S. citizens to avoid airport gates due to security threats. \"U.S. citizens should avoid traveling to the airport and should avoid airport gates at this time due to security threats outside the airport perimeter,\" the embassy warned in a statement.\n\nPresident Biden, during a speech at the White House on August 30, vowed to retaliate against the perpetrators of the Kabul airport attack. \"To those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,\" Biden said.\n\nThe military action against IS-K follows warnings from U.S. intelligence officials that another terror attack in Kabul is 'likely' as the U.S. approaches its deadline for military withdrawal from Afghanistan, which is set for September 11, 2021.\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan marks the end of America's longest war, which started in 2001 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The Taliban seized control of Kabul on August 15, marking the end of the Afghan government's control over the country.\n\nThe drone strike in Nangahar province serves as a reminder of the ongoing threats to U.S. personnel and interests in the region, even as the U.S. military prepares to withdraw from Afghanistan. \"The U.S. remains committed to preventing terrorist groups from using Afghanistan to threaten the United States and its allies,\" Urban concluded in his statement."}

According to Christopher Ballod, Associate Managing Director for Cyber Risk at Kroll, \"DarkSide represents a significant threat due to their advanced techniques and financial acumen.\"\n\nDarkSide's \"double extortion\" strategy involves stealing sensitive data before encrypting files, giving the group leverage to demand larger ransoms or sell the stolen information to third parties. Phil Wittmann, an attorney at Stone Pigman Walther Wittmann, explained, \"The theft of data before encryption increases the pressure on organizations to pay the ransom to prevent the public exposure of their confidential information.\"\n\nDarkSide carefully selected its targets based on financial analysis and information gleaned from corporate emails. Michael Walshe Jr., Chair of the Management Committee at Stone Pigman Walther Wittmann, stated, \"DarkSide's targeted approach to selecting victims demonstrates a high level of sophistication and planning.\"\n\nTo infiltrate target networks, DarkSide employed advanced techniques like \"zero-day exploits,\" which exploit vulnerabilities in software for which no patch is yet available. Ballod noted, \"Zero-day exploits give attackers a significant advantage, as they can bypass security measures that rely on known vulnerabilities.\"\n\nOnce inside a target's network, DarkSide moved swiftly to encrypt files and exfiltrate data. They also investigated victims' cyber insurance policies to tailor ransom demands effectively. Wittmann commented, \"DarkSide's understanding of cyber insurance policies is a testament to their research capabilities and knowledge of the cyber threat landscape.\"\n\nDarkSide's quick attack window and demands on the high end, typically $5 million or more, put pressure on organizations to respond rapidly. Ballod cautioned, \"The window of opportunity for organizations to prevent a ransomware attack is shrinking, making it essential for them to invest in robust cybersecurity measures and incident response plans.\"\n\nDarkSide threatened to share stolen information with short-sellers if publicly traded companies refused to pay the ransom. Wittmann warned, \"The potential for public disclosure of sensitive information can lead to significant reputational damage and financial losses for organizations.\"\n\nAfter DarkSide's shutdown by law enforcement, affiliates complained on a forum that they had not been paid their share of the ransoms. Walshe Jr. commented, \"The lack of transparency in ransomware-as-a-service operations can lead to mistrust among affiliates and potential legal repercussions.\"\n\nSeven of Tantleff's clients paid ransoms ranging from $1.25 million to $6 million after negotiations from higher initial demands. Wittmann emphasized, \"Paying the ransom is not an ideal solution, but it may be the most effective way to mitigate the damage caused by a ransomware attack and prevent the public disclosure of sensitive information.\""}

Gadde's influence within Twitter and the tech industry underscores the company's growing role in shaping media and politics, despite its smaller size compared to competitors.\n\nGadde, who has been with Twitter since 2009, was an active participant in confronting Trump's incitement of violence leading up to the ban. In a recent interview with MSNBC, she said, \"We took this action based on two things: the risk of further incitement of violence and the need to protect public conversation.\"\n\nThe decision to ban Trump was seen as a bold move but sparked discussions on the power and responsibilities of social media platforms. Former Twitter COO Adam Bain weighed in, stating, \"Social media companies have a responsibility to ensure their platforms are not used to incite violence or spread misinformation.\"\n\nTwitter initially suspended Trump for 12 hours before permanently banning him due to the risk of further violence. Facebook and YouTube also took action against Trump, with varied terms and conditions. Facebook suspended Trump's account indefinitely, while YouTube removed some, but not all, of his videos.\n\nFollowing the Trump ban, Twitter faces regulatory challenges in other countries. In Nigeria, Twitter was banned after removing a controversial tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari. In India, Twitter is navigating complex legal challenges after refusing to fully comply with government requests to censor accounts.\n\nGadde's leadership at Twitter has been instrumental in the company's involvement in global policy decisions, interacting with governments and advocating for openness and trust. In a recent interview with the Verge, she said, \"We've always believed that it's important for us as a company to be transparent, to be open, and to engage with governments and other stakeholders.\"\n\nGbenga Sesan, Executive Director of Paradigm Initiative, a digital rights organization based in Nigeria, shared his thoughts on Twitter's role in shaping media and politics: \"Twitter's decision to ban Trump was a significant moment in the history of social media. It highlighted the power of these platforms to influence political discourse and the need for responsible use.\"\n\nUnder Gadde's leadership, Twitter has taken a more assertive stance on content moderation, banning high-profile accounts such as Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Russia's state-controlled media outlet RT. However, this approach has not been without controversy, with some critics arguing that the company is overstepping its bounds and infringing on free speech.\n\nAs Twitter continues to grapple with regulatory challenges and shape the future of social media, Gadde's influence within the company and the tech industry will remain a key factor. In a recent interview with CNBC, she emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability: \"Our goal is to ensure that the conversations on our platform are healthy, safe, and authentic.\"\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the Trump ban and Twitter's role in shaping media and politics, Gadde remains steadfast in her belief that social media companies have a responsibility to protect public conversation and ensure the safety of their users. As she told MSNBC, \"We take our responsibilities seriously, and we will continue to take action when necessary to protect the health of the public conversation on our platform.\""}

The CMA, which is responsible for enforcing consumer protection laws, had previously expressed concerns about the illegal trade of fraudulent reviews on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nIn January 2020, Facebook agreed to improve its efforts to identify and remove such groups in response to the CMA's concerns. However, a follow-up investigation by the CMA found that the problem was still persisting on the platform.\n\nAndrea Coscelli, Chief Executive of the CMA, stated, \"It is simply not acceptable for companies to use fake reviews to manipulate consumers' online choices. We welcome Facebook's commitment to take stronger action against these groups, but it is important that they continue to prioritise this issue.\"\n\nFake reviews involve purchasing positive reviews to boost sales or negative reviews to harm competitors. These activities are often coordinated on Facebook and Instagram, where people can create and join groups dedicated to trading such reviews.\n\nFacebook spokesperson responded, \"We have extensively engaged with the CMA on this issue, and we take their concerns seriously. Fraudulent activities, including the buying and selling of fake reviews, are not allowed on our platforms. We have introduced new technology to automatically flag and remove such groups, and we will continue to take action against those involved.\"\n\nThe issue of fake reviews is not unique to Facebook. A 2018 investigation by consumer group Which? found \"factories\" producing fake reviews for Amazon, with 71% of headphones on the site having perfect five-star ratings. Many of these reviews referred to unrelated products and were overwhelmingly unverified.\n\nA spokesperson for Which? said, \"Fake reviews are a major problem for consumers. They can mislead people into buying products that are not as good as they seem, or deter them from buying products that are excellent. We welcome Facebook's efforts to tackle this issue, but it's clear that more needs to be done by all online platforms to protect consumers.\"\n\nFacebook's response to the CMA's concerns came after the regulator issued a formal warning to the company in 2019, expressing disappointment in Facebook's delayed response. The CMA had previously urged Facebook to take stronger action against groups trading fake reviews.\n\nIn addition to suspending or banning users involved in trading fake reviews, Facebook has also introduced new technology to automatically flag and remove such groups. The company has pledged to continue its efforts to tackle the issue.\n\nThe CMA's investigation into Facebook's handling of fake reviews is ongoing, with the regulator expected to publish its final report in the coming months. Other e-commerce sites, including Amazon, eBay, and Google, have also faced scrutiny over the issue of fake reviews in recent years.\n\nFacebook's commitment to addressing the issue of fake reviews is a positive step towards protecting consumers online. However, it is clear that more needs to be done by all online platforms to tackle this issue effectively and prevent the spread of misleading information.\n\nAndrea Coscelli reiterated, \"The CMA will continue to take action against companies that mislead consumers online. We will not hesitate to take enforcement action where necessary to protect people from harm.\"\n\nThe removal of over 16,000 groups trading fake reviews on Facebook is a significant step in the right direction. However, it is important to remember that the fight against fake reviews is an ongoing one, and all stakeholders must work together to ensure that consumers are not misled online.\n\nFacebook's response to the CMA's concerns demonstrates its commitment to addressing the issue of fake reviews. However, it is crucial that the company continues to invest in technology and resources to identify and remove such groups in a timely manner.\n\nThe CMA's investigation into Facebook's handling of fake reviews is a reminder that online platforms have a responsibility to protect consumers from misleading information.

I'll be joining Facebook as a senior fellow, where I'll be focusing on recruitment and AI investments.\"\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, praised Schroepfer's contributions to the company: \"Mike is a close friend and someone I've had the privilege of working with for almost a decade. He's been a critical part of Facebook's journey, helping us build some of our most important infrastructure and products.\"\n\nBosworth, who has been with Facebook since 2006, will take on the role of CTO on January 1, 2022. In a statement, he expressed his excitement for the new challenge: \"I'm looking forward to continuing to work with Mark, Sheryl [Sandberg], and the entire team to build the next generation of technology and services that connect and empower billions of people around the world.\"\n\nSchroepfer's departure and Bosworth's promotion highlight Facebook's strategic push into augmented and virtual reality. Bosworth's work in this area is seen as foundational to Facebook's efforts in building the 'metaverse,' a digital space merging social and physical worlds. Zuckerberg has expressed a vision for Facebook to transition into a 'metaverse company,' emphasizing its future direction.\n\nZuckerberg's ambitions for Facebook's future were underscored by other recent executive departures from the company. David Fischer, Facebook's Chief Revenue Officer, announced in October that he would be stepping down at the end of the year. Hugo Barra, who led Facebook's VR efforts, left the company in September.\n\nSamidh Chakrabarti, a former Facebook director, expressed concern about Schroepfer's departure: \"Mike's departure is a big loss for Facebook. He's been a key architect of the company's infrastructure and has played a critical role in its growth. I wish him all the best in his new role.\"\n\nSchroepfer's departure comes as Facebook faces increasing scrutiny from regulators and the public. The company has been under fire for its handling of misinformation, hate speech, and user data privacy. In a statement, Schroepfer acknowledged the challenges facing the company: \"Facebook is at an inflection point, and I believe it's important for the company to have new leadership at the CTO role as it embarks on its next chapter.\"\n\nDespite these challenges, Zuckerberg remains optimistic about Facebook's future: \"We have a lot of work to do, but I'm confident that with the right team in place, we can continue to build products and services that bring people closer together and help them build community.\"\n\nAs Schroepfer prepares to step down, he leaves behind a legacy of technical innovation and strategic vision. His departure marks a new chapter in Facebook's story, one that will be shaped by the leadership of Bosworth and Zuckerberg.\n\n\"I'm proud of what we've accomplished together, and I'm excited to see what comes next,\" Schroepfer wrote in his Facebook post. \"I believe in Facebook's mission, and I'll be cheering you all on from the sidelines.\"\n\nWith Bosworth at the helm, Facebook is poised to double down on its investments in augmented and virtual reality, and to continue its transformation into a 'metaverse company.' The future may be uncertain, but one thing is clear: Facebook is not standing still.\n\n\"We're just getting started,\" Zuckerberg said in a statement. \"I'm looking forward to working with Andrew to build the next generation of technology and services that connect and empower billions of people around the world.\""}

Jamie Raskin's Personal Loss and Urgent Call to Remove Trump: Impeachment and 25th Amendment\n\nIn the aftermath of his son's tragic death and the chaos of the Capitol riot, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) has assumed a pivotal role in the Democratic effort to address the ongoing threat posed by former President Donald Trump. As the House's lead manager for Trump's impeachment trial, Raskin emphasizes the urgency in removing Trump from office, and he is considering both impeachment and invoking the 25th Amendment as means to achieve that goal.\n\nThe recent events have left an indelible mark on Raskin, who faced the Capitol insurrection with his daughter and son-in-law present. His family's personal tragedy and the political turmoil have fueled his determination to hold Trump accountable for his actions.\n\nSpeaking to ABC News in an exclusive interview, Raskin criticized the Senate's failure to convict Trump during the first impeachment trial and expressed concern over potential pardons for those involved in the Capitol siege. He is pressing for swift action to prevent further damage.\n\nRaskin, a constitutional law professor and longtime congressman, supports the 25th Amendment as a potential bipartisan solution but is also pushing for impeachment. The amendment allows for the removal of a president who is unable to discharge the duties of the office due to mental or physical incapacity.\n\n\"The president has demonstrated that he's not capable of putting the national interest above his own political interests,\" Raskin said in the interview. \"He has shown a complete disregard for the rule of law and for the Constitution.\"\n\nThe impeachment process, Raskin believes, is necessary to hold Trump accountable for his role in inciting the Capitol insurrection and to prevent him from further damaging the nation. He points to Trump's refusal to condemn the violence and his continued false claims of election fraud as evidence of his dangerous disregard for the law.\n\nTrump's actions during the Capitol riot, Raskin argues, pose a clear and present danger to the country. \"The President incited a violent insurrection against the United States Congress in an attempt to overturn the lawful results of a free and fair election,\" he said. \"He must be held accountable for that.\"\n\nRaskin also raised concerns over the potential for Trump to pardon those involved in the Capitol siege, further undermining the rule of law and the justice system. \"The President has the power to grant pardons, but he should not be using that power to reward lawbreakers,\" he said.\n\nReflecting on the events of January 6, Raskin condemned Trump's role and lack of denouncement of the violence. \"It was a dark day in American history,\" he said. \"The President's refusal to acknowledge the violence and condemn it in real time was a betrayal of his oath of office and a betrayal of the American people.\"\n\nRaskin's call for Trump's removal from office is not only a political one but a deeply personal one as well. His son, Tommy Raskin, died by suicide on New Year's Eve 2020, just days before the Capitol riot. Raskin and his family have been coping with their loss while also dealing with the political upheaval.\n\n\"The last few weeks have been a challenging time for my family and me,\" Raskin said. \"The loss of my son and the chaos at the Capitol have tested us in ways that are hard to describe.\"\n\nDespite the personal challenges, Raskin remains committed to his role in the impeachment process and to holding Trump accountable. He believes that the country cannot move forward until Trump is removed from office.\n\nThe impeachment trial is set to begin in the Senate soon, and Raskin and his team are preparing their case against Trump. They plan to present evidence of Trump's actions leading up to and during the Capitol riot.\n\nRaskin's call for Trump's removal from office has garnered support from many Democrats and some Republicans. However, it remains to be seen whether the Senate will convict Trump and remove him from office.\n\nThe stakes are high, both for the country and for Raskin and his family. The outcome of the impeachment trial could have lasting consequences for American democracy and for the Raskin family's personal healing process. As the trial unfolds, the nation will be watching closely.\n\nThis article is also featured in an episode of the 'Start Here' podcast by ABC News, focusing on significant current news. Listen to the episode for a more in-depth discussion on Rep. Jamie Raskin's call for Trump's removal from office and the ongoing efforts to address the threat posed by the former president."}

The 1,300-foot vessel, as long as the Empire State Building is tall, became lodged in the canal on March 23 due to poor visibility and high winds.\n\nThe Suez Canal Authority (SCA) orchestrated a multifaceted operation to dislodge the Ever Given, enlisting the assistance of dredgers, tugboats, and utilizing high tide conditions. \"This is a complex and intricate process,\" explained Gregory Tylawsky, a licensed shipmaster and founder of the Maritime Expert Group. \"It is like trying to free an enormous beached whale.\"\n\nGiven the Ever Given's sheer size and the challenging conditions, experts initially pondered how to extricate the ship. \"It's a daunting task,\" admitted Gary Cordes, a retired shipmaster and senior adviser at the Maritime Expert Group. \"The technical challenges are vast, and the consequences of a misstep could be catastrophic.\"\n\nThe Suez Canal, a crucial waterway for global trade, facilitates the passage of approximately 15% of all shipping. \"The Suez Canal is a vital link in the global maritime supply chain,\" emphasized Ragui Assaad, a professor at the University of Minnesota and research fellow at the Economic Research Forum in Cairo. \"Its disruption can have ripple effects on international trade and commerce.\"\n\nAround-the-clock efforts to free the Ever Given commenced as soon as the SCA assessed the situation. Dredgers, including the 10th of Ramadan and the Mashhour, and more than 10 tugboats were mobilized. Peter Berdowski, the CEO of Dutch dredging company Boskalis, spearheaded the dredging process, removing sand, mud, and water from around the vessel.\n\nTo aid in refloating the Ever Given, 9,000 tons of its ballast water were released. \"This was a critical step in our efforts to refloat the vessel,\" said Berdowski. \"By reducing its weight, we were able to create the necessary buoyancy for the Ever Given to break free.\"\n\nThe Ever Given was fully dislodged on March 29, with the operation coinciding with high tide conditions due to a full moon. \"The timing could not have been better,\" said Tylawsky. \"The combination of the tide and our efforts managed to free the vessel.\"\n\nThe successful freeing of the Ever Given was met with jubilation from workers, who had labored tirelessly to resolve the situation. \"It's a relief to finally have this resolved,\" said an SCA spokesperson. \"Our team has worked around the clock to ensure the safe passage of this vessel and to minimize the impact on global trade.\"\n\nThe implications of the Ever Given's predicament and subsequent release extended far beyond the Suez Canal. \"This incident underscores the importance of the Suez Canal and the need for contingency plans in the event of disruptions,\" explained Assaad.\n\nAs global trade continues to rebound from the pandemic, the Ever Given incident serves as a reminder of the inherent complexities and challenges faced by the maritime industry. \"We've seen firsthand the critical role that the Suez Canal plays in global commerce,\" said Cordes. \"It's a testament to the resilience and ingenuity of those who work in the maritime sector.\""}

But it's unlikely to completely absolve defendants.\"\n\nDefendants have cited Trump's rhetoric, especially his speech on January 6 urging supporters to \"fight like hell,\" as a call to action. Ziv Cohen, a clinical psychiatrist, explained, \"There's a phenomenon known as the 'charismatic leader' effect. Trump's words had a profound impact on his followers.\"\n\nHowever, Trump's defense attorneys deny that he incited the riot, placing the blame squarely on the rioters themselves. Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University, noted, \"There's a significant difference between inspiring passion and inciting violence. The former is protected by the First Amendment, the latter is not.\"\n\nStatements by the accused that they were acting on Trump's instructions may also be used in the impeachment trial against him. The concept of \"public authority defense\" might be argued, suggesting rioters believed they were acting on government orders.\n\n\"The public authority defense is a long-standing principle in criminal law. It's based on the idea that people may reasonably believe they're following lawful orders,\" Paulsen explained.\n\nExperts, however, are skeptical that shifting blame to Trump will significantly impact the legal outcomes for the accused individuals. Latoison acknowledged, \"It's a strategy, but it won't be an easy sell.\"\n\nSome rioters explicitly stated that their actions were in response to Trump's call, including storming the Capitol if he requested. One defendant's statement read, \"I would do anything for President Trump. If he asked me to storm the Capitol, I would have.\"\n\nThe influence of Trump and other officials may be considered as a mitigating factor, though unlikely to completely absolve defendants. As Paulsen put it, \"The law recognizes that people are influenced by the powerful figures in their lives. But ultimately, individuals are responsible for their own actions.\"\n\nAs the legal proceedings unfold, it remains to be seen how much weight the courts will give to the defendants' claims of following Trump's instructions. Regardless, the events of January 6, 2021, continue to reverberate, both in the courtroom and in the broader national discourse."}

In its latest report, the Monitor sheds light on parents' views regarding vaccines for their children, mask mandates in schools, and schools' efforts to limit the spread of the virus.\n\nAccording to the KFF survey, approximately half (48%) of parents of children between the ages of 12 and 17 have reported that their child has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. This number is significantly lower among parents of younger children, with only about a third (34%) stating they will vaccinate their 5-11-year-old 'right away' once a vaccine is authorized for their age group.\n\nThe survey reveals that 32% of parents will 'wait and see' before getting their 5-11-year-old vaccinated, and 24% say they definitely will not vaccinate their child. This reluctance is particularly pronounced among certain demographic groups, including parents with lower incomes and those without a college degree.\n\nMasks continue to be a contentious issue, with 58% of parents expressing their belief that K-12 schools should require masks for all students and staff. Among parents with a child attending in-person school, 69% reported that their school was requiring masks for all students and staff. However, 23% of these parents stated that their child had been required to quarantine due to a possible COVID-19 exposure.\n\nParents' perceptions of their children's schools' efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 are generally positive, with 66% of parents believing their child's school is doing the right amount. Despite this, only 6% of parents reported that their school district offers routine COVID-19 testing to students not eligible for the vaccine.\n\nConcerns about the potential severity of the virus for children are high, with 57% of parents expressing worry that their child may get seriously sick from coronavirus. This concern is more pronounced among Hispanic and lower-income parents.\n\nThe KFF report also highlights the importance of addressing vaccine hesitancy, particularly among parents of younger children. Outreach efforts that focus on building trust and providing accurate information about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines could play a crucial role in increasing vaccination rates among this demographic.\n\nSchools can also take steps to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by implementing robust testing programs, maintaining mask mandates, and providing clear communication to families about exposure incidents and quarantine protocols. These measures can help parents feel more confident in sending their children to school and contribute to a safer learning environment.\n\nThe KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor provides valuable insights into parents' attitudes and experiences regarding COVID-19 vaccines and school safety. As the pandemic continues to evolve, it is essential to stay informed about these trends and the factors that influence them. By working together to address vaccine hesitancy and support schools' efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19, we can help protect the health and well-being of our children and communities."}

In one tweet, Trump addressed his supporters, saying, \"The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!\"\n\nIn another tweet, Trump announced, \"To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.\" Twitter viewed this message as potentially inciting further violence, as some of his supporters have called for the president to \"fight\" the election results.\n\nMike Hahn, social media director for the Trump campaign, responded to the suspension in a statement: \"This is a shameful and unconstitutional act of suppression by a directly biased 'social media' monopoly,\" Hahn said. \"We always knew that Twitter was not a fair or impartial platform, but this ban is a clear attempt to silence the President of the United States and the millions of Americans who support him.\"\n\nCivil rights leaders and organizations praised Twitter for taking a stand against hate speech and division. Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a statement, \"Twitter made the right call in banning President Trump's account. His words have incited violence and hate, and have no place on the platform or in our society.\"\n\nEric Naing, spokesman for Muslim Advocates, added, \"We commend Twitter for taking swift and decisive action to remove President Trump's account, which has been a platform for hate speech and incitement to violence. This is a step in the right direction for social media companies to hold those in power accountable for their actions.\"\n\nTwitter's ban is specifically for the @realDonaldTrump account, with measures in place to prevent ban evasion. Trump attempted to circumvent the ban by tweeting from the @POTUS account, but those messages were quickly removed. The Trump campaign's Twitter account was also permanently banned after attempting to share Trump's banned tweet.\n\nTwitter differentiated between journalists reporting on Trump's words and accounts attempting to circumvent the ban by repeating those words. \"We believe it's important to clarify that our action was taken due to the circumstances of the situational context, not because of the content of the tweet itself,\" Twitter Safety said. \"Our goal is to enforce our rules without bias and ensure a healthy conversational environment on the platform.\"\n\nThe suspension of Trump's account marks a significant moment in social media history, as the president has used Twitter as a primary means of communication with his supporters since taking office in 2017. It remains to be seen how this decision will impact the political landscape in the final days of Trump's presidency and beyond."}

Newark school buildings were not exempt from the destruction, suffering from a fire, flooding, and the destruction of gym floors.\n\nInitial estimates indicate at least $5 million in damage to Newark schools, but the actual cost is expected to rise as the extent of the damage becomes clearer. Nearby school districts considered delaying the start of the school year due to the widespread destruction, but Newark schools opened as scheduled.\n\n\"Our maintenance crews, custodians, and other employees have worked tirelessly to ensure our schools were ready for students,\" said Dawn Haynes, Newark school board president. \"Their dedication to our children and this district is truly inspiring.\"\n\nHaynes praised the district employees for putting their needs aside for the sake of the children, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a sense of normalcy amidst the chaos.

Rittenhouse's not guilty verdict has compelled the crowdfunding platform to clarify its stance on fundraisers for individuals acquitted of violent crimes.\n\nAt present, GoFundMe's Terms of Service prohibit fundraisers for individuals charged with violent crimes. However, following Rittenhouse's acquittal, GoFundMe acknowledged that individuals acquitted of such charges could create fundraisers for their legal defense and living expenses.\n\nGoFundMe's stance on the matter has sparked a contentious debate over fairness and the potential for wrongful convictions. In light of the Rittenhouse case, the company has faced backlash and disabled replies to its tweet explaining the policy. GoFundMe subsequently posted a detailed explanation on Medium about its Terms of Service.\n\nGoFundMe maintains that its policies aim to prevent fundraisers that support hate, violence, harassment, bullying, discrimination, or involve weaponry. However, the situation raises questions about the moral authority and consistency of GoFundMe's policies. Critics argue that the platform's stance may deny financial assistance to individuals who have been wrongfully convicted.\n\nGoFundMe has insisted that it continually evaluates and evolves its Terms of Service to address new factors. The company claims to prioritize human rights in its fundraising policies. Yet, the controversy surrounding the Rittenhouse case highlights the need for a nuanced approach to these issues.\n\nGoFundMe, like many platforms, grapples with striking a balance between maintaining a safe and inclusive environment for users and upholding the principles of justice and fairness.

A Hypothetical Exploration of a Missed Opportunity\n\nNew Orleans Saints legend Drew Brees made headlines last offseason when he announced his decision to return for the 2020 NFL season, aiming for a second Super Bowl victory with the Black and Gold. However, the veteran quarterback's campaign was marred by a series of injuries, leading to speculation about what could have been if he had retired a season earlier.\n\nESPN reporter Jeff Darlington shed light on this intriguing scenario during an episode of 'Get Up.' According to Darlington, Tom Brady, the eventual Super Bowl LV champion with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was on the verge of signing with the Saints before ultimately deciding to join forces with his former head coach, Bruce Arians, in Florida.\n\nQuote from Jeff Darlington: \"Tom Brady was really close to signing with the Saints. New Orleans was very much in the mix for him.\"\n\nBrady's interest in the Saints was significant, as evidenced by his decision to meet with Sean Payton and the team's brass. However, it was Brees' choice to continue playing that ultimately swayed Brady's decision.\n\nQuote from Jeff Darlington: \"Drew Brees' decision to come back had a big impact on Tom Brady's decision.\"\n\nIf Brady had joined the Saints, the team could have potentially landed high-profile free agents such as Rob Gronkowski, Antonio Brown, and Leonard Fournette to bolster their roster.\n\nBrady's health and performance metrics during the 2020 season were significantly better than Brees'. Brady threw for 4,633 yards, 40 touchdowns, and just 12 interceptions, while Brees managed just 2,979 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 5 interceptions before suffering a rib injury that sidelined him for several games.\n\nThe hypothetical scenario of the Saints' success with Brady at the helm is an unanswered question. What if the Saints had secured a top-tier tight end in Gronkowski? How would Antonio Brown have fit into the team's offense? And what impact would Leonard Fournette have had in the backfield?\n\nWith Brees' injury-riddled season, the Saints ultimately turned to Jameis Winston to fill in as the starting quarterback. Winston's tenure with the team began with a bang, as he led the Saints to a victory against the Atlanta Falcons in the season finale.\n\nAs the Saints look towards the future, the focus shifts to Winston. The former Buccaneers quarterback has shown flashes of brilliance, but his inconsistency remains a concern.\n\nWinston's development will be a key factor in the Saints' success in the 2021 season. The team's front office and coaching staff will need to strike a delicate balance between giving Winston the opportunity to grow and maintaining the winning culture Payton has established in New Orleans.\n\nThe Saints' 2021 offseason promises to be an intriguing one. With the NFL Draft and free agency on the horizon, the team will have opportunities to add talent to their roster and address their needs at various positions.\n\nStay tuned to Canal Street Chronicles for the latest Saints news, updates, and analysis as the team navigates the offseason and prepares for the 2021 campaign. In the meantime, let us know your thoughts on what could have been if Tom Brady had joined the Saints in the comments below."}

I am deeply grateful for this opportunity to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris and engage in discussions that will strengthen the already robust relationship between our two nations.\n\nAs we gather here today, let us take a moment to reflect on the rich history that has brought us to this point. Our bilateral relationship officially began in 1957, the year Ghana gained its independence, but the ties between our people stretch far beyond that. Many Americans have traveled to Ghana in search of their ancestry and a deeper understanding of the history of slavery, a testament to the deep cultural connections that bind us.\n\nVice President Harris, I want to express my gratitude for your warm welcome and for recognizing the importance of this relationship. Our two nations share a commitment to democracy, a value that is deeply rooted in the hearts and minds of our people. This commitment is evident in Ghana's free and fair elections, which have been praised by international observers.\n\nWe understand that democracies thrive when all individuals are fully engaged, and that they are weakened when some are excluded. Together, we will continue to work towards ensuring that every voice is heard and that every citizen has the opportunity to contribute to the development of our nations.\n\nOur partnership extends beyond democratic values. Both Ghana and the United States are committed to global health, and we recognize that we are stronger when we collaborate and share resources. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of international cooperation, and we are grateful for the United States' support in our fight against this global health crisis.\n\nThe United States, a member of COVAX and the African Union, has donated over 1.2 million doses of the Moderna vaccine to Ghana, and plans to send more than 1.3 million Pfizer vaccine doses. These donations are a testament to the enduring friendship between our peoples, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration in the fight against future pandemics.\n\nIn addition to our health partnership, we are also working to expand our economic relationship. American companies are ramping up their presence in Ghana, and we are committed to creating an environment that is conducive to business growth and job creation.\n\nVice President Harris, I want to commend the Ghanaian government for creating a confidence-inspiring environment through our respect for the rule of law and human rights. These values are essential to building a strong and prosperous nation, and we are committed to upholding them.\n\nAs we look to the future, we are excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. We look forward to continued collaboration, including in the context of the United Nations Security Council. Together, we can make a difference in the world, and I am confident that our friendship will only grow stronger in the years to come.\n\nIn conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, today marks an important milestone in the relationship between Ghana and the United States. Our shared commitment to democracy, global health, and economic growth has brought us to this point, and I am optimistic about the future. Vice President Harris, thank you for your warm welcome and for recognizing the importance of this relationship. Together, we can make a difference in the world.\n\nAs we move forward, let us remember the words of the great Ghanaian statesman, Kwame Nkrumah, who once said, \"Seek ye first the political kingdom, and all things shall be added unto you.\" Let us continue to work towards building strong and prosperous nations, rooted in the values of democracy, human rights, and respect for the rule of law.\n\nThank you."}

Wilson: Pioneering Biologist, Ant Expert, and Controversial Sociobiologist\n\n(Edward Osborne Wilson, a groundbreaking biologist known for his work on ants and sociobiology, faced controversy and opposition throughout his career, but his passion for nature and exploration led to major scientific discoveries and efforts to preserve biodiversity. Born with a love for the natural world, Wilson described hundreds of new species and studied social insect behavior, changing our understanding of communication and behavior. However, his pioneering work in sociobiology, which linked behavior to evolutionary and genetic factors, sparked widespread debate and controversy. Wilson experienced physical attacks and fierce opposition from figures like Richard Lewontin and Steve Gould, but he sought to address the controversy with his Pulitzer Prize-winning book \"On Human Nature.\" Despite a difficult childhood and loss of vision in one eye, Wilson's passion for exploring nature persisted, leading him to major scientific discoveries. He distanced himself from fundamentalist Protestantism after discovering evolutionary theory, and while not an atheist, he expressed skepticism about organized religion.

At least 30 people have lost their lives due to the treacherous weather conditions, and the new storm could bring up to 9 inches of snow in some areas, according to The Weather Channel.\n\nFreezing rain in Austin and San Antonio, Texas, has left everything covered in a layer of ice. The storm moved through Oklahoma and Texas, causing widespread power outages and water disruptions, and is now affecting the Deep South.\n\nJudge Lina Hidalgo, the elected leader of Harris County, which includes Houston, urged residents to stay off the roads. \"We've seen some significant icing in areas where we don't usually see it,\" she said in a press conference. \"Stay home, stay safe.

The account, which had amassed an impressive following of 88.7 million people, was a significant platform for the President's communications.\n\nTrump's last tweets before the suspension indicated his refusal to attend the inauguration and voiced support for his supporters. He hinted at a 'GIANT VOICE' for them in the future, fueling concerns of potential unrest. The suspension of his account came as a shock to his followers and raised questions about free speech and censorship.\n\nTwitter cited the risk of further incitement of violence as the reason for the permanent suspension, stating that the President's tweets were in violation of the company's policy against glorifying violence. The decision followed Trump's history of pushing the boundaries of Twitter's rules against election misinformation, glorifying violence, and spreading COVID-19 falsehoods.\n\nAfter the suspension, Trump attempted to use the @POTUS account to criticize Twitter and claim suppression of free speech. However, those tweets were quickly deleted, as the use of the account was seen as an attempt to evade suspension and a violation of Twitter's rules.\n\nThe @TeamTrump account was also permanently suspended for ban evasion, further emphasizing Twitter's commitment to enforcing its policies. The suspension marked a significant shift in the company's approach to enforcing its rules against high-profile users.\n\nFacebook and Instagram have also suspended Trump's accounts indefinitely, at least through the end of his term. The social media giants cited the risk of further incitement of violence as the reason for the suspension, following the storming of the Capitol.\n\nThe ban followed Twitter locking Trump out of his account after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The incident marked a turning point in the ongoing debate over social media's role in regulating content and protecting public safety.\n\nTwitter's enforcement follows its public interest framework but emphasizes that no account is above the rules. The company stated that it would continue to monitor the situation and take action as necessary to protect the public conversation.\n\nThe permanent suspension of Trump's account marks a significant moment in the history of social media and the presidency. It raises important questions about the role of social media in shaping public discourse and the balance between free speech and public safety.\n\nThe decision to ban Trump's account has been met with mixed reactions, with some praising Twitter for taking a stand against hate speech and incitement of violence, while others criticizing the company for suppressing free speech.\n\nThe suspension of Trump's account is not the first time Twitter has taken action against high-profile users. In the past, the company has suspended the accounts of prominent figures such as Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos for violating its rules.\n\nAs the debate over social media's role in regulating content and protecting public safety continues, it is clear that the permanent suspension of Trump's account marks a significant turning point in the history of social media and the presidency. Only time will tell how this decision will shape the future of online discourse and the role of social media in shaping public opinion."}

Although WhatsApp faces scrutiny for issues like misinformation and monopoly accusations, it is also seen as a tech force for good in the global South. However, the dependence on a single private company for such essential communication raises concerns about data privacy and digital ecosystem diversity.\n\nThe global outage served as a reminder of the risks and consequences of relying too heavily on a single platform for communication.

The authorities are still investigating the incident, and no charges have been filed against Baldwin, who has stated he is \"fully cooperating\" with the investigation.\n\nTrump's skepticism was palpable during the podcast interview. \"Why would Baldwin point the gun at the cinematographer instead of an actor?\" Trump wondered aloud. \"Why would he pull the trigger if it wasn't intentional? It just doesn't add up.\"\n\nStigall, the podcast host, did not challenge Trump's theory but instead asked, \"Do you think something more sinister might have been at play?\" Trump responded, \"I don't know, Chris, but I've seen some pretty strange things in my day, and this one takes the cake.\"\n\nBaldwin had previously expressed his shock and sadness over the tragic event. \"There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother and deeply admired colleague of ours,\" Baldwin said in a statement. \"I'm fully cooperating with the police investigation to address how this tragedy occurred.\"\n\nFollowing the incident, Baldwin has advocated for a police presence on movie and television sets to monitor firearms safety. \"In light of the tragic accident on the set of Rust, it's clear that the film industry must come together to insure [sic] the safety of all cast and crew on set,\" Baldwin tweeted from his art foundation.\n\nTrump's comments sparked backlash from Baldwin's supporters, who accused the former president of exploiting a tragedy for political gain. \"Trump's reckless comments are not only baseless, but they also undermine the importance of a thorough investigation,\" said a spokesperson for Baldwin.\n\nIn response to Trump's theory, Baldwin's attorney, Luke Nikas, issued a statement saying, \"The suggestion that Mr. Baldwin is to blame for the tragic death of Halyna Hutchins is categorically false.\"\n\nTrump's critique of Baldwin did not stop at the shooting incident. \"This guy, Baldwin, he's a nutjob, a real cuckoo-bird,\" Trump said, referring to Baldwin's volatile public persona. \"I've always thought he was a little unhinged.\"\n\nThe investigation into the shooting continues, and no definitive conclusions have been reached regarding the cause of the tragedy. \"We need to let the authorities do their job and find out what really happened,\" said a spokesperson for the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office.\n\nMeanwhile, the film industry is grappling with the implications of the shooting and the need for increased safety measures on sets. \"This is a wake-up call for all of us in the film industry,\" said a spokesperson for the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. \"We need to make sure that every set is a safe working environment for everyone involved.\""}

The unexpected disruption impacted Facebook's flagship social network, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, causing widespread inconvenience for billions of users. However, some devices, such as the Oculus Quest headset, exhibited only partial functionality.\n\nDespite the outage, the Oculus Quest headset managed to start up and display installed apps. However, many essential Facebook services, including the app store and avatars, were unavailable. Users were unable to download new games or updates, limiting the functionality of their devices.\n\nDespite these limitations, players could still launch and play downloaded games. In some cases, they could even connect with others online, offering a glimmer of normalcy during the extended outage. However, the inability to access new content underscored the inherent vulnerabilities of app- and cloud-connected devices that rely heavily on online services.\n\nFacebook's Ray-Ban smart glasses were another casualty of the outage. While the glasses could still take photos and videos, they were unable to share them due to the inability to connect to the Facebook-connected app. This issue further emphasized the need for devices that can operate independently of cloud services.\n\nThe outage served as a stark reminder of the broader issue of reliance on cloud-based services and the potential for service disruptions. The event highlighted the importance of having multiple companies provide apps and social networks to prevent a single point of failure. It also underscored the need for local file storage and reduced reliance on a single company for communication and work needs.\n\nThe outage raises questions about the future of VR and AR technologies, which are increasingly relying on cloud services for content delivery and social interaction. The incident underscores the importance of developing more resilient and independent AR and VR technologies that can operate effectively even during service disruptions.\n\nAs the world becomes increasingly reliant on technology for communication, work, and entertainment, it is essential to recognize the vulnerabilities of heavily cloud-dependent devices. The Facebook outage serves as a reminder that relying on a single company for essential services can lead to significant inconvenience and disruption. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to invest in more resilient technologies and diversify our sources of apps, social networks, and cloud services."}

This is democracy's day,\" Biden said in his inaugural address. \"A day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve. Through a crucible for the ages, America has been tested anew. And in this test, we saw failure, we saw perseverance, and we saw belated but powerful resolve.\"\n\nDuring his remarks, Trump did not mention Biden by name but wished the incoming administration \"great luck\" and \"great success.\" Melania Trump, the former first lady, also issued a statement congratulating the Bidens.\n\n\"Being your First Lady was my greatest honor,\" Melania Trump said in a statement. \"I wish the new First Lady and your family the very best. I am rooting for you and will be in your prayers. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.\"\n\nFollowing the ceremony, Biden signed his first presidential documents, including an Inauguration Day Proclamation and nominations. He and Harris then participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery with former presidents and their spouses.\n\nBiden also signed over a dozen executive actions, many of which reversed Trump policies, including rejoining the Paris climate accord, extending eviction moratoriums, and reversing the travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries.\n\n\"Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this: bringing America together, uniting our people, and restoring the soul of our nation,\" Biden said in his executive orders.\n\nTrump's absence from the ceremony was a stark contrast to his inauguration in 2017, when he became the first president in more than a century to skip the traditional inaugural luncheon following the swearing-in ceremony.\n\nAs Biden took the oath of office, a sense of relief and optimism washed over the nation's capital, with many hoping for a return to normalcy and unity following a tumultuous four years under Trump.\n\n\"We're here to witness the peaceful transfer of power,\" Biden supporter Katie Massey told CNN. \"It's historic, but it's just what's supposed to happen. It's what makes us who we are as a country.\"\n\nTrump's refusal to concede the election and his false claims of widespread voter fraud fueled the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, leaving five people dead and prompting heightened security measures for the inauguration.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the new administration, Biden emphasized respect and unity among White House staff.\n\n\"Let's get to work,\" Biden said as he signed his first executive orders. \"This is a new day for America.\"\n\nAs Biden and Harris took their places in the Oval Office for the first time, they were greeted by a White House staff that had been asked to sign a code of conduct pledging to treat each other with respect and dignity.\n\n\"We're going to be an administration that's going to be focused on bringing the country together,\" Biden senior adviser Cedric Richmond said. \"It's going to be an administration that's going to be focused on getting things done for the American people.\"\n\nBiden's inauguration marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter in American history.

A recent study by the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs sheds light on the extensive loss of power and water that crippled Harris County, revealing startling statistics and resident concerns.\n\nRenée Cross, Senior Director of the Hobby School of Public Affairs, emphasizes the severity of the situation, stating, \"Harris County residents faced unprecedented challenges during the winter storm, from power and water outages to difficulty accessing basic necessities.\"\n\nAccording to the study, 66 people died in Harris County alone, nearly one-third of the almost 200 storm-related fatalities in Texas. Among those surveyed, 89% of Harris County residents reported losing electrical power, compared to 71% statewide. Moreover, over 70% of respondents in Harris County reported losing access to clean water.\n\nMark P. Jones, Senior Research Associate at the Hobby School, shares his insights on the situation, \"The winter storm exposed significant vulnerabilities in Harris County's infrastructure, leaving thousands of residents without essential services for extended periods.\"\n\nBeyond power and water, residents faced additional challenges, including the loss of internet connectivity and difficulties obtaining food. The study reveals that over 60% of those surveyed in Harris County had no internet access for more than a week due to power outages.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, the majority of Harris County residents (71%) expressed their support for the development of alternative energy sources like wind and solar to enhance energy security. This sentiment is echoed by Renée Cross, who notes, \"The winter storm has underscored the importance of investing in renewable energy sources and diversifying our energy mix to ensure resilience in the face of extreme weather events.\"\n\nDespite the clear need for change, many residents were compelled to resort to unsafe heating methods due to prolonged power outages, risking carbon monoxide poisoning. Over 40% of those surveyed in Harris County reported using alternative heating sources, such as generators or wood-burning stoves, during the storm.\n\nMoreover, the study indicated that storm preparedness was inadequate, with 79% of respondents believing power cuts were not equitably distributed. Mark P. Jones points out, \"The winter storm exposed significant gaps in emergency preparedness and response, highlighting the need for more robust infrastructure and communication systems.\"\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and Governor Greg Abbott received high disapproval ratings for their handling of the storm, with over 70% of Harris County residents expressing dissatisfaction in the study. Renée Cross remarks, \"The winter storm has shone a spotlight on the need for greater accountability and transparency from our energy providers and government officials.\"\n\nText alerts from local and county government were crucial for residents during the storm, despite cell reception issues. Over 80% of those surveyed in Harris County reported that these alerts were helpful in staying informed and safe during the crisis. Renée Cross concludes, \"Effective communication is essential during emergency situations, and Harris County residents have underscored the importance of investing in robust and reliable communication systems.\"\n\nAs Harris County and the rest of Texas continue to recover from the devastating winter storm, the study provides valuable insights into the challenges faced by residents and the need for change. Renée Cross and Mark P. Jones' findings emphasize the importance of investing in renewable energy sources, improving emergency preparedness and response, and enhancing communication systems to ensure energy security and resilience in the face of extreme weather events."}

The media's relentless push to portray Rittenhouse as a white supremacist and an illegal rifle carrier across state lines was not only baseless but also damaging to the truth.\n\nDuring the tumultuous protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in the summer of 2020, Rittenhouse, then 17, found himself in the midst of chaos, ultimately firing his rifle in self-defense against alleged attackers. Following a well-documented and fair trial, Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges, a verdict based on the facts and the rule of law.\n\nSadly, the media's portrayal of Rittenhouse did not align with the facts. A Reuters Institute Poll reveals that only 29% of Americans trust U.S. media. Such mistrust is not unfounded, as the media's handling of the Rittenhouse case illustrates. No evidence was presented to support the claims that Rittenhouse was a white supremacist or a domestic terrorist.\n\nMoreover, Rittenhouse did not transport a rifle across state lines. Wisconsin law permits 18-year-olds to carry rifles, and Rittenhouse, who turned 18 a few days after the incident, was lawfully in possession of his weapon. The media's eagerness to sensationalize the situation contributed significantly to the public's confusion and division.\n\nUnfortunately, the fallout from the media's false narratives did not cease after the trial. Public figures and media outlets, in their fervor to condemn Rittenhouse, levied defamatory statements against him. These accusations demand scrutiny and, potentially, legal actions.\n\nThe media's role in perpetuating misinformation and defamation against Rittenhouse calls for accountability. In a society that values truth and justice, the consequences of the media's actions are far-reaching, threatening the fabric of our democratic institutions and the trust between the people and the press.\n\nAs we reflect on the Kyle Rittenhouse case, it is essential to remember the importance of impartial reporting and factual accuracy. The media plays a vital role in shaping public opinion, and the erosion of trust will have long-term consequences for our society. Let us strive for a media landscape that values truth, fairness, and the rule of law, ultimately restoring faith in our institutions and strengthening the bonds that unite us as a nation."}

He led an all-star cast in Tampa Bay to a Super Bowl win last season and turned a group of journeymen in New England into championship-winning contributors.\n\nTroy Brown, Brady's leading receiver in their first Super Bowl victory and now a coach for the Patriots, shared his thoughts on Brady's ability to elevate teammates. \"Tom's a great competitor, and I've always admired that about him,\" Brown said. \"He's made many players household names throughout his career, and it's a testament to his leadership.\"\n\nFormer teammate Jermaine Wiggins echoed Brown's sentiments. \"Tom's longevity and skill are incredible,\" Wiggins said. \"I'm still a little surprised and nostalgic about his departure from New England, but I'm excited to watch him continue to succeed.\"\n\nBrady's collaboration with Hall of Famer Randy Moss during the 2007 season is a prime example of his ability to work with elite talent.

The upcoming game holds a sense of competition but not personal animosity for Brown. \"Tom's a great competitor, and I'm sure he'll be ready to go,\" Brown said. \"But at the end of the day, it's about putting on a great show for the fans.\"\n\nBelichick, the Patriots head coach, reflected on Brady's departure. \"Tom made a decision based on his options,\" Belichick said. \"It wasn't about not wanting him here.\" Brady has kept the details of his departure and relationship with Belichick private, stressing that everything was handled gracefully.\n\nBrown and Wiggins, now part of Brady's opposition, praised his skills and leadership. \"Tom's ability to read defenses and make quick decisions is unparalleled,\" Brown said. \"He's always been able to bring out the best in his teammates, and I have no doubt he'll continue to do so in Tampa Bay.\"\n\nWiggins added, \"Tom's work ethic and dedication to the game are second to none. He's a true professional, and I have nothing but respect for him.\"\n\nAs Brady gears up for the highly anticipated matchup against his former team, the underlying theme remains his unparalleled ability to lead and bring out the best in his teammates, no matter where he plays.\n\nBrady, when asked about facing the Patriots, kept his focus on the task at hand. \"I'm just excited to be back on the field and competing against some of the best in the league,\" Brady said. \"It's going to be a great game, and I'm looking forward to it.\""}

However, even without new legislation, some financial assistance is on the way for eligible families.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed during a recent press briefing that more federal money could be coming to some Americans. \"The President is committed to ensuring that families have the resources they need during this pandemic,\" she stated. \"That's why we've expanded the Child Tax Credit, and why we're working to provide mortgage and rental assistance.\"\n\nStarting July 15, families will begin receiving monthly payments through a temporary expansion of the Child Tax Credit. The expansion, which is part of the COVID-19 stimulus bill signed by President Joe Biden in March, will provide $250 for each child ages 6 to 17, and $300 for every kid younger than 6 for six months. The remaining amount will be available as refunds in next year's taxes.\n\nIn addition to the child tax credit expansion, homeowners struggling with their mortgage payments due to COVID can access a $10 billion homeowner assistance fund, also part of Biden's COVID rescue package. The relief for renters includes $46.6 billion in emergency aid from recent pandemic relief bills to help with unpaid rent and utilities.\n\nHowever, there is ongoing discussion about another conventional stimulus check, with some proposals calling for $2,000 monthly payments or automatic payments in response to financial triggers. This potential relief faces challenges, including the perception that the economy may be recovering.\n\nDespite these debates, Jen Psaki indicated that Biden is open to the idea of another stimulus check. \"The President has been clear that he wants to see Americans get the support they need during this pandemic,\" she said. \"But right now, his focus is on passing his infrastructure package and his families plan.\"\n\nFor those not eligible for the mentioned checks or aids, there are other ways to find financial relief. Nonprofit organizations, community resources, and government assistance programs can offer assistance with food, housing, healthcare, and other essential needs.\n\nThe economic impact of the pandemic has affected millions of Americans, leaving many struggling to make ends meet. While the debate over a fourth stimulus payment continues, the expansion of the child tax credit and mortgage and rental assistance provide some much-needed relief for eligible families."}

However, the tragic confluence of recent events—with over 147 mass shootings in the US as of April 16th, and more than 60 people killed by police during this period, many of them Black or of Latin American descent—demands a more comprehensive examination of the interrelated crises of police violence and gun culture in America.\n\nSome police and their representatives argue against gun reform, maintaining that the Second Amendment right to bear arms protects them from potential threats. Yet, the indisputable fact that the US is the most heavily armed society on the planet, with studies consistently indicating that more guns correlate with more homicides, challenges this notion. Moreover, police officers in areas with lax gun laws face heightened risks of death, leading to a vicious cycle of increased lethal force.\n\nThe deeply entrenched concept of qualified immunity allows officers to act on the perceived threat of a gun without legal consequences, even if that threat is not real. Proponents of the Second Amendment argue that this right safeguards against government tyranny. However, the reality is that it often contributes to violent encounters between citizens and law enforcement. The presence of guns in society, fortified by the Second Amendment, creates conditions that justify lethal force, ultimately perpetuating a cycle of violence and fear.\n\nRacial disparities in police shootings are an undeniable facet of this crisis. People of color are disproportionately targeted and killed by police, often perceived as threats due to implicit biases. A comprehensive approach to addressing police violence must include gun control measures and an unwavering commitment to dismantling systemic racism within law enforcement.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that police lobbying against gun control serves their interests by preserving a status quo that allows for the use of lethal force with impunity. As we advocate for gun control, we must also call on law enforcement to lead by example in disarmament. Only then can we hope to break the cycle of violence and work towards a safer, more equitable society for all."}

The incident could have significant economic implications, affecting oil and gas shipments and global trade.\n\nThe Suez Canal Authority (SCA) announced on Tuesday that the Ever Given, operated by Evergreen Marine Corp., had run aground in the narrow canal, which carries around 10% of world trade. Lt. Gen. Ossama Rabei, head of the Suez Canal Authority, stated, \"We are working to refloat the ship as soon as possible.\"\n\nTugboats and dredgers were deployed to the scene, with concerns growing about the potential for a prolonged blockage. Salvatore R. Mercogliano, an associate professor of history at Campbell University, commented on the potential consequences, \"A prolonged closure could cause significant economic disruption, particularly for countries in the Middle East and Europe that rely heavily on imports from Asia.\"\n\nThe cause of the ship becoming lodged was not immediately clear, with initial reports suggesting a blackout and strong winds. Evergreen Marine Corp. mentioned that the Ever Given had been overcome by strong winds, but the SCA has not confirmed this as the primary cause.\n\nSecurity concerns have been raised about idling ships potentially becoming targets for attacks in the region. According to Lt. Gen. Rabei, \"We have increased security measures to ensure the safety of ships and crews.\"\n\nThe blockade could have far-reaching economic implications, particularly for oil and gas shipments. Approximately 30% of global liquefied natural gas and 8% of the world's oil pass through the Suez Canal each year.\n\nThe incident underscores the challenges faced by the shipping industry, which has been under pressure due to the pandemic. According to Mercogliano, \"The pandemic has already disrupted global supply chains, and a prolonged closure of the Suez Canal could exacerbate these issues.\"\n\nThe Ever Given is one of the largest container ships in the world, measuring 1,312 feet long and 180 feet wide. It was en route from China to Rotterdam when it became lodged in the canal.\n\nThe SCA and Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, the ship's German manager, are working together to resolve the situation. According to a statement from Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, \"Our primary concern is the safety of the crew, passengers, and the environment.\"\n\nThe Ever Given carries approximately 18,000 containers, many of which contain electronics, clothing, and other consumer goods. The disruption to their delivery could have ripple effects throughout the global economy.\n\nThe SCA has not yet estimated how long it will take to refloat the ship or reopen the canal. In the meantime, ships are being rerouted through the southern tip of Africa, adding weeks to their journeys and increasing costs.\n\nThe Suez Canal has been a critical trade route since its opening in 1869. It links the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, allowing ships to bypass the lengthy and more expensive journey around the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nThe incident is reminiscent of a similar event in 2009, when the container ship MV Rena ran aground off the coast of New Zealand, causing significant environmental damage and disrupting shipping traffic.\n\nAs the world waits for the Ever Given to be refloated and the canal to reopen, the economic and logistical implications of the blockage continue to unfold."}

This marks the first suspected fatal alligator attack in modern times in the state.\n\nQuote from Dr. Charles Preston (St. Tammany Parish Coroner): \"The remains were found in the alligator's stomach. Based on the condition of the remains, it appears Mr. Satterlee's death will likely be ruled an accident.\"\n\nSatterlee's disappearance came in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, which brought widespread devastation to Louisiana and the Northeast, resulting in numerous fatalities, primarily due to flooding.\n\nAccording to reports, Satterlee's wife, who wished to remain anonymous, was present during the attack. She witnessed the alligator rip off one of Satterlee's arms before the man was dragged into the water.\n\nQuote from the wife: \"I screamed for help, but no one came. When I returned, both Tim and the alligator were gone.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, a 12-foot-long, 504-pound alligator was captured and killed by St. Tammany Parish deputies near Satterlee's home. Human remains were subsequently found inside the alligator.\n\nLouisiana is home to over 2 million wild alligators, making encounters between humans and the reptiles relatively common. However, fatal attacks on humans are extremely rare.\n\nQuote from Dr. Charles Preston: \"Historically, there's at least one other suspected fatal alligator attack in Louisiana, dating back to 1774. On average, alligators are responsible for one human death annually in the U.S.\"\n\nAlligators are generally considered to be opportunistic feeders and pose little threat to humans unless provoked. They are an integral part of Louisiana's ecosystem and are protected under state and federal law.\n\nSatterlee's tragic death serves as a grim reminder of the power and unpredictability of nature, especially in the aftermath of a catastrophic storm like Hurricane Ida.\n\nQuote from Dr. Charles Preston: \"We urge residents to exercise caution when encountering alligators, especially during mating season and after natural disasters like Hurricane Ida.\"\n\nAs the investigation into Satterlee's death continues, his family and friends mourn the loss of a beloved husband, father, and friend. The alligator that took his life will serve as a somber reminder of the delicate balance between humans and wildlife in Louisiana."}

John Guilfoil, Principal of John Guilfoil Public Relations LLC, emphasized the importance of diversifying communication methods to mitigate potential disruptions.\n\nMany brands and organizations utilize Facebook for various purposes, including advertising, retail outreach, virtual events, and customer service. The widespread outage caused communication disruptions for those solely relying on Facebook for these functions.\n\nJohn Guilfoil: \"The Facebook outage was a wake-up call for businesses and organizations that have become overly reliant on this single platform for their communication and operational needs.\"\n\nSome entities, including town fire chiefs, have come to prefer Facebook over creating and updating their own websites due to its ease of use and widespread reach. However, the outage resulted in the disappearance of critical news archives and communication disruptions for these organizations.\n\nGuilfoil encourages the use of simple, free tools to create websites and advocates a 'web first' approach. By focusing on a website as the primary means of communication, organizations can ensure their content remains accessible even during platform outages.\n\nDuring the Facebook outage, advised clients were able to maintain communication through alternative platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and email. These tools served as valuable backup systems, allowing organizations to continue engaging with their audiences and addressing customer inquiries.\n\nGuilfoil emphasized the importance of having backup systems and contingency plans in place to mitigate the risks of communication disruptions: \"In today's fast-paced business environment, it's crucial for organizations to have multiple communication channels and to be prepared for unexpected disruptions.\"\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder of the importance of websites and diversified communication strategies, even in the era of dominant social media platforms. By focusing on a web-first approach and utilizing multiple communication channels, organizations can ensure their messaging remains accessible and their audiences remain engaged.\n\nThe Facebook outage also highlighted the potential consequences of a single entity controlling such a significant portion of the digital communication landscape. Critics argue that this concentration of power can lead to increased vulnerabilities and potential disruptions.\n\nGuilfoil urges organizations to reevaluate their communication strategies and consider the risks associated with over-reliance on a single platform: \"It's important for businesses and organizations to regularly assess their communication channels and consider the potential risks and benefits of each platform.\"\n\nThe Facebook outage underscores the need for organizations to be adaptable and responsive in the face of unexpected disruptions. By maintaining a diverse communication strategy and having backup systems in place, organizations can minimize the impact of potential outages and continue engaging with their audiences.\n\nAs the digital communication landscape continues to evolve, it's essential for organizations to remain agile and proactive in their communication strategies.

In a heartfelt statement, the couple emphasized the importance of unity and compassion in overcoming the ongoing pandemic.\n\nArchewell has partnered with several organizations, including Global Citizen and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to promote worldwide vaccine access and support the COVAX initiative. For every $5 donation made through their campaign, these organizations will contribute an additional $15, enough to cover the cost of four vaccine doses.\n\nThe Sussexes' statement highlighted the stark global disparity in vaccine distribution, with approximately 80% of doses administered in wealthier nations, leaving many lower-income countries struggling to secure enough vaccines for their populations. Harry and Meghan stressed the urgency of addressing this issue, noting that \"we cannot rest or truly recover until we are all safe.\"\n\nAs they have done in previous years, the couple acknowledged the support and acts of kindness from the public in honor of Archie's birthdays.

This decision comes following a thorough analysis of the available safety and efficacy data.\n\nActing FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D., stated, \"Expanding the eligibility for booster doses to individuals 18 years and older is an important step in protecting more Americans against this devastating virus.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will discuss further clinical recommendations regarding the use of booster doses during their upcoming meeting. These recommendations will inform healthcare providers and the public on the appropriate timing and population groups for COVID-19 booster doses.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, emphasized the importance of streamlining eligibility criteria and clarifying booster availability for individuals. \"We understand that many Americans have questions about booster doses, and we are committed to providing clear and science-based guidance,\" Marks said.\n\nThe FDA's authorization of booster doses for the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines is based on immune response data analysis. This data indicates that the effectiveness of these vaccines decreases over time, particularly against the SARS-CoV-2 variant. A booster dose can help restore vaccine effectiveness and provide continued protection against COVID-19.\n\nCompleting the primary vaccination series with any FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine provides strong, sustained, and broadly neutralizing antibodies. This protection is expected to offer nearly 100% efficacy against secondary challenges from the pandemic strain. Woodcock emphasized, \"Vaccines are our best defense against COVID-19, and getting vaccinated remains the most effective way to protect yourself and those around you.\"\n\nThe FDA and the CDC continue to emphasize the importance of vaccinations and precautions against respiratory pathogens, including COVID-19, influenza, and the common cold. Individuals are encouraged to speak with their healthcare providers about their individual risk factors and vaccination needs. As Marks concluded, \"Vaccines save lives, and we will continue to work closely with our partners at the CDC and across the public health community to ensure that Americans have access to the most up-to-date and effective tools to protect their health.\""}

Woods will team up with his 12-year-old son, Charlie, in the two-man PNC Championship at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida.\n\nThe February 2021 accident left Woods with open fractures to his tibia and fibula, along with damage to his ankle and soft tissues in his lower right leg. Following the accident, Woods was largely bedridden for three months and began walking with crutches about two months post-accident.\n\nDespite the challenges, Woods has shown resilience and determination in his recovery. He has been able to practice golf, focusing on chipping and putting, and playing short-game competitions with Charlie. \"I've been able to chip and putt and do some short-game stuff,\" Woods said. \"And it feels like I'm getting close to where I can start hitting balls again.\"\n\nWoods acknowledges that his leg and back will never be the same, affecting his ability to maintain a full golfing schedule and practice regimen. \"I think something's going to give out at some point,\" Woods admitted. \"But I don't want to sit around and just watch golf.

Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, faced charges including first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, and attempted first-degree intentional homicide. The verdict was handed down on November 19, 2021, following a highly publicized trial.\n\nThomas Binger, the lead prosecutor in the case, expressed his disappointment with the jury's decision, stating, \"I respect the fact that the jury's verdict is binding, but I strongly disagree with it.\"\n\nAt the heart of the case was Rittenhouse's presence in Kenosha with an illegally obtained AR15 rifle. Rittenhouse claimed he was in the city to protect a local business and provide medical aid during the protests. However, the prosecution, led by Thomas Binger, argued that Rittenhouse was the instigator of deadly conflict and responsible for the only killings that night.\n\nMark Richards, the lead attorney for Kyle Rittenhouse, maintained throughout the trial that his client acted in self-defense and was attacked by protesters. Richards stated, \"My client went to Kenosha to help, to protect, and to save lives, not to take them. He did what he had to do to save his own life.\"\n\nDuring the trial, witnesses were called to testify for both the prosecution and the defense. Friends of Rittenhouse, an FBI agent, a local resident, Gaige Grosskreutz (a survivor of the shooting), and a Daily Caller reporter all took the stand. Gaige Grosskreutz, who was armed with a gun during the encounter with Rittenhouse, testified, \"I saw the defendant pointing his rifle at me, and I dropped my gun and put my hands up.\"\n\nThe defense presented evidence that Rittenhouse had been attacked earlier in the night and was in fear for his life during the incidents in question. Rittenhouse himself testified, stating, \"I didn't want to shoot that night. I didn't want to take a life. But I was forced to defend myself.\"\n\nKenosha County judge Bruce Schroeder's conduct during the trial has been questioned for apparent bias towards the defense. Schroeder allowed certain witnesses to testify without objection from the prosecution and denied motions that could have potentially strengthened the prosecution's case. Schroeder stated, \"The evidence speaks for itself, and it's up to the jury to decide.\"\n\nThe public reaction to the verdict has been polarized, with some seeing Rittenhouse as a hero and others viewing the outcome as a miscarriage of justice. Supporters of Rittenhouse argue that he was acting in self-defense and that the protests in Kenosha had turned violent. Critics argue that Rittenhouse should not have been in Kenosha with an illegal weapon and that the jury's decision sets a dangerous precedent.\n\nThomas Binger, in a statement following the verdict, stated, \"We respect the decision of the jury. However, it is important to remember that this case was about much more than just the actions of one individual on one night. It was about the actions of many individuals in the days and weeks leading up to that night, and the systemic issues that continue to plague our community and our country.\"\n\nThe trial of Kyle Rittenhouse marked a pivotal moment in the ongoing national conversation about gun rights, self-defense, and the role of civilians in law enforcement. Regardless of one's perspective on the case, it is clear that the events in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 25, 2020, have left a lasting impact on the community and the nation as a whole. As the country continues to grapple with these complex issues, the case of Kyle Rittenhouse will undoubtedly remain a topic of debate and discussion for years to come."}

The massive vessel, longer than the height of the Eiffel Tower, blocked one of the world's most crucial trade arteries.\n\nShipping experts warn that even slight delays can lead to significant congestion and disturb the delivery of goods. According to analysts at S&P Global Platts, \"The blockage of the Suez Canal is a major disruption to global seaborne trade, and the longer it lasts, the more significant the impact will be.\"\n\nThe severity of the disruption depends on how quickly the Ever Given can be removed. As of now, the vessel has been partially re-floated, but it is uncertain when it will be completely free.\n\nThe Suez Canal is a crucial trade route between Asia and Europe, handling roughly one eighth of all sea-transported goods in 2019. Chris Evans, an international supply chain expert at Colliers International, stated, \"The Suez Canal is a significant chokepoint in global trade. Any disruption to its operation can have far-reaching implications.\"\n\nThe blockage happens at a time when trade is increasing post-Chinese New Year and businesses are restocking for post-pandemic expectations. Samir Madani, Co-Founder of TankerTrackers, explained, \"The Suez Canal blockage could not have come at a worse time, as global trade is just starting to recover from the pandemic.\"\n\nGlobal shortage of shipping containers and COVID-19 safety measures have already been causing delays at ports. Analysts are concerned that the Suez Canal blockage could exacerbate these issues.\n\nAs of March 25, 2021, 42 vessels (northbound) and 64 vessels (southbound) are waiting due to the blockage, with the numbers expected to rise. Chris Evans believes the blockage will be cleared quickly, minimizing delays. However, any prolonged blockage could lead to significant shipping delays, increased costs, and operational challenges.\n\nMadani stated, \"The Ever Given is causing a ripple effect throughout the global supply chain. Delayed vessels mean delayed cargoes, which could lead to shortages and higher prices for consumers.\"\n\nThe impact on global trade extends beyond congested shipping lanes. Analysts are concerned about the impact on oil prices and the necessity for ships to take longer routes.\n\nAnalysts at S&P Global Platts explained, \"The blockage of the Suez Canal could lead to increased oil prices due to the disruption of seaborne crude and petroleum product trade.\"\n\nThe Ever Given is owned by the Taiwanese company Evergreen Marine Corporation. The exact cause of the grounding is still under investigation.\n\nEvans stated, \"The Suez Canal is an essential link in global trade, and any disruption to its operation can have significant consequences. However, it is important to remember that the global supply chain is resilient, and it will adapt to this disruption as quickly as possible.\"\n\nMadani added, \"The global shipping industry is no stranger to disruptions, but the Suez Canal blockage is unique in its scale and impact. It is a reminder of the interconnectedness of global trade and the importance of maintaining the flow of goods and services.\"\n\nAs of March 26, 2021, salvage teams were working around the clock to free the Ever Given. The vessel was being tugged by a flotilla of ships, including the Italian heavy lift vessel, X-Press Capricorn.\n\nThe successful removal of the Ever Given from the Suez Canal will bring much-needed relief to the global shipping industry. However, the impact of the disruption will be felt for weeks, if not months, to come. Evans concluded, \"The Suez Canal blockage is a reminder of the importance of maintaining the flow of goods and services in a globalized world. It is a testament to the resilience of the global supply chain and the determination of those working to keep it moving.\""}

It's a serious matter that can result in criminal charges and disrupts the learning environment for students.\"\n\nThe impact of these threats on the mental health of students, staff, and parents cannot be ignored. Sproles acknowledged, \"These threats can be traumatizing for students and staff. We want to remind everyone that counseling services are available to anyone who needs them.\"\n\nParents can support their children after a threat or shooting incident by maintaining open lines of communication, encouraging healthy coping mechanisms, and seeking professional help if necessary.

It is essential that social media platforms take their responsibility seriously and ensure that their platforms are not used to spread hate speech, lies, or to incite violence.\"\n\nTrump's posts, which included a video addressing rioters, claims of voter fraud, and expressions of empathy toward his supporters, were cited as the reasons for the bans.\n\nFacebook's Zuckerberg emphasized, \"Given the current circumstances and the risks of further incitement of violence, we have taken the unprecedented step of removing these statements. We removed these statements because we believe they contribute to rather than diminish the risk of ongoing violence.\"\n\nTwitter also stressed that further violations by Trump would lead to permanent suspension.\n\nThroughout 2020, Twitter had increasingly labeled Trump's tweets as disputed or containing manipulated media.\n\nShopify, an e-commerce platform, suspended Trump's online merchandise shops, citing its policy against condoning violence.\n\nHowever, the bans have sparked controversy, with some arguing that they infringe on freedom of speech, while others argue that the platforms have a responsibility to protect their users and prevent the spread of misinformation and incitement to violence.\n\nAs the world watches the unfolding events, the role of social media in shaping public discourse and influencing political outcomes remains a topic of intense debate.\n\nIn conclusion, the events at the US Capitol and the subsequent bans on Trump's social media accounts underscore the significant role social media plays in shaping public discourse and influencing political outcomes. The responsibility of social media platforms to ensure their platforms are not used to spread hate speech, lies, or to incite violence cannot be overstated. As the world moves into a new political era, the need for clear rules and regulations governing social media use becomes increasingly apparent.\n\nJensen emphasized, \"The events in Washington, D.C., serve as a reminder that social media is a powerful tool that can be used for good or for harm. It is essential that we establish clear rules and regulations to ensure that social media platforms are not used to spread hate speech, lies, or to incite violence.\"\n\nWeber added, \"The responsibility of social media platforms to protect their users and prevent the spread of misinformation and incitement to violence is paramount. It is essential that they take their responsibility seriously and ensure that their platforms are used in a responsible and ethical manner.\"\n\nAs the political landscape continues to evolve, the role of social media in shaping public discourse and influencing political outcomes will remain a topic of intense debate. The events at the US Capitol serve as a reminder of the power of social media and the need for clear rules and regulations to ensure that it is used in a responsible and ethical manner.\n\nIn the words of Jensen, \"The events in Washington, D.C., have shown us that social media plays a significant role in shaping public discourse and influencing society. It is essential that we establish clear rules and regulations to ensure that social media platforms are not used to spread hate speech, lies, or to incite violence.\""}

Initially, experts suspected the cause was the harsh weather conditions, but investigations are ongoing to determine if technical or human errors played a role.\n\nThe rescue operation involved a fleet of dredgers and tugboats, aided by a spring tide from a full moon, which managed to refloat the vessel on Monday. The Ever Given is now being towed to the Great Bitter Lake for inspection.\n\nThe Ever Given's grounding was a significant disruption for the Suez Canal, one of the world's busiest waterways, with an average of 50 vessels passing through daily. The blockage threatened extensive economic impacts, as some ships were forced to take a longer route around Africa, raising concerns about piracy.\n\nThe Suez Canal is a critical maritime link, connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas, and the blockage had the potential to disrupt global trade flows, especially for energy and agricultural commodities.\n\nEgypt, which operates the Suez Canal, contributed $5.6 billion to its revenue in 2020. The canal is a vital source of income for the country, making up around 10% of its economy.\n\nThe Ever Given, built in 2018, is one of the world's largest container ships, with a capacity of 20,124 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). The vessel was on its way from China to Rotterdam when it became stuck.\n\nThe traffic jam resulting from the Ever Given's grounding affected a diverse range of cargo, including electronics, textiles, automobiles, and raw materials. Some ships had to wait for days to pass through the canal, delaying their deliveries.\n\nThe European Commission expressed concerns over the potential economic impact of the blockage, estimating that it could result in losses of up to €10 billion ($11.8 billion) for European businesses.\n\nThe American Shipper's Association warned that the disruption could result in delays and increased transportation costs for U.S. importers and exporters.\n\nIndia's Ministry of External Affairs stated that the blockage could impact India's imports of crude oil and natural gas.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates' Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure said that the blockage could lead to a shortage of oil and gas supplies for the Middle East and Europe.\n\nThe French shipping firm CMA CGM, one of the world's largest container shipping companies, estimated that the blockage could cause a ripple effect, potentially resulting in delays and increased transportation costs for up to 12,000 containers.\n\nAs the Ever Given remained stuck, maritime experts warned of the risks of piracy for ships forced to take the longer route around Africa. The Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea are known piracy hotspots.\n\nSome shipping companies took precautions to protect their vessels, increasing security measures and rerouting their ships.\n\nThe Egyptian authorities, the Suez Canal Authority, and the international community worked together to resolve the crisis as quickly as possible.\n\nThe Suez Canal Authority reported that it had spent around $1 billion to resolve the crisis. This included the cost of hiring additional tugboats, dredgers, and other equipment.\n\nThe successful refloating of the Ever Given marked the end of a tense and costly week for the global shipping industry.\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder of the importance of the Suez Canal as a critical maritime link and the potential economic impact of disruptions to global trade.\n\nAs the Ever Given continues its journey, investigations into the cause of the grounding will continue. Preliminary reports suggest that high winds and a sandstorm may have played a role, but technical or human errors are also being investigated.\n\nThe resolution of the Ever Given crisis brings relief to the global shipping industry, but the long-term economic impacts of the disruption remain to be seen."}

This grim milestone has left experts and historians questioning the implications of this devastating pandemic.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. have exceeded 675,400 as of October 2021. The 1918 Spanish flu, a pandemic that swept across the world during the final year of World War I, caused approximately 675,000 American deaths.\n\nThe U.S. represents about 14% of global Covid-19 deaths, despite having a national population that is only 4.2% of the global total. The disproportionate impact of the virus on American lives has raised concerns about the country's response to the pandemic.\n\nHoward Markel, the Director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, shares his perspective on the significance of these numbers: \"The 1918 flu pandemic was a defining moment in American history. Now, we find ourselves at another such moment with Covid-19.\"\n\nCécile Viboud, an Infectious Diseases Epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania, emphasizes the importance of understanding the implications of these numbers: \"Comparing Covid-19 to historical events like the Spanish flu or the Civil War can help us contextualize the scale of this crisis.\"\n\nDavid Morens, a Medical Historian at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, offers a nuanced perspective on the comparison: \"While it's clear that Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on American lives, we must remember that historical context is essential when making these comparisons.\"\n\nComparisons between Covid-19 and the Spanish flu must consider significant differences in population size, age of fatalities, and available medical technology. The Spanish flu disproportionately affected young adults, while Covid-19 has had a more significant impact on older populations.\n\nVaccines have significantly reduced the risk of death from Covid-19, yet fatalities continue. As of October 2021, approximately 53% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated.\n\nThe global Covid-19 death toll is likely an underestimate, with research suggesting U.S. deaths could be 10% higher than reported. A study published in the journal PLOS Medicine estimated that Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. could be as high as 750,000 by the end of 2020.\n\nMarkel emphasizes the importance of learning from this pandemic for future preparedness: \"Historically, pandemics have presented us with opportunities to reevaluate our systems and adapt to new challenges. Covid-19 is no exception.\"\n\nThe U.S. response to Covid-19 has been criticized, especially regarding its early stages. Many experts argue that earlier and more coordinated action could have saved countless lives.\n\nMorens shares his thoughts on the U.S. response: \"There's no doubt that the U.S. response to Covid-19 could have been more effective. We've learned valuable lessons that will inform our approach to future outbreaks.\"\n\nThe pandemic has prompted a reevaluation of historical precedents for responding to disease outbreaks. Governments and international organizations are working to improve their crisis response capabilities.\n\nViboud emphasizes the importance of addressing the root causes of health disparities: \"The disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on marginalized communities underscores the need for a more equitable approach to public health.\"\n\nMarkel agrees: \"We cannot afford to ignore the systemic issues that contribute to health disparities. Covid-19 has shown us that addressing these issues is not only a moral imperative, but a public health necessity.\"\n\nMorens stresses the importance of investing in research and development: \"The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a more robust research infrastructure. We must invest in the development of new vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics.\"\n\nThe pandemic has also underscored the importance of global cooperation in addressing public health crises. The World Health Organization (WHO) has played a crucial role in coordinating the global response.\n\nViboud emphasizes the importance of maintaining a strong public health infrastructure: \"Covid-19 has shown us that a strong public health infrastructure is essential for addressing crises. We must invest in this infrastructure to ensure we're prepared for future challenges.\"\n\nMarkel agrees: \"We cannot afford to take our eyes off the ball when it comes to public health. The lessons we learn from Covid-19 must inform our approach to future crises.\""}

The report warns that the Lone Star State is most at risk, potentially facing a 37% energy shortfall, following the deadly February storms that left millions without electricity and water, resulting in 210 deaths and over $50 billion in damages.\n\nMark Olson, NERC's manager of reliability assessments, highlighted the vulnerabilities in electricity and natural gas systems exposed by Winter Storm Uri. He stated, \"Winter Storm Uri demonstrated that extreme weather events can impact the reliability of the bulk electric system and the natural gas infrastructure.\"\n\nResidents affected by previous outages also encountered billing and insurance issues, with some receiving electric bills over $1,000 a day. John Moura, NERC's director of reliability assessment, expressed disappointment over the Electric Reliability Council of Texas' (ERCOT) susceptibility to extreme conditions. He stated, \"It's disheartening to see such a large portion of the U.S. population at risk of losing power during extreme weather events.\"\n\nNERC advises power companies to prepare for extreme winter weather through emergency plans, drills, and generator readiness checks. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas plans to inspect 300 power plants over 21 days in December to prevent outages.\n\nDespite these efforts, the Biden Administration declared a national disaster in Texas following the February storms, and NERC's report also indicates risk in the South and Midwest, but Texas remains the greatest concern.\n\nOlson emphasized the importance of preparing for extreme weather events, stating, \"The consequences of not being adequately prepared for extreme weather events can be severe. It's crucial that utilities and grid operators take the necessary steps to minimize the risk of power outages during these events.\"\n\nIn response to NERC's report, ERCOT spokesperson Leslie Sopko stated, \"ERCOT takes the findings of NERC seriously and is committed to improving the reliability and resilience of the Texas electric grid. We are working closely with NERC, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, and other stakeholders to address the recommendations in the report.\"\n\nNERC's report comes as another winter storm is expected to hit Texas this week, potentially bringing freezing temperatures and power outages to the state. Texas Governor Greg Abbott urged residents to prepare for the storm and encouraged them to sign up for emergency alerts.\n\nAbbott stated, \"Winter weather can be dangerous, and it's important for Texans to take precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones. I urge all Texans to sign up for emergency alerts, monitor weather conditions, and follow the guidance of their local officials.\"\n\nDespite these warnings, some Texans remain skeptical of the power grid's ability to withstand extreme weather. One resident, who experienced power outages during Winter Storm Uri, stated, \"I don't trust the power company to keep the lights on during a winter storm. I've invested in backup generators and solar panels to ensure I have power no matter what.\"\n\nAs Texas and other regions prepare for the winter season, the lessons learned from Winter Storm Uri remain fresh in the minds of utilities, grid operators, and residents alike. The importance of being adequately prepared for extreme weather events cannot be overstated, and the ongoing efforts to improve the reliability and resilience of the power grid will be closely watched by all."}

Trump from their platforms, cutting off his primary means of communication with millions of followers.\n\nFacebook, which owns Instagram, extended Trump's ban until at least January 2023, citing public safety concerns following the riot. A Facebook spokesperson stated, \"The situation surrounding the U.S. Capitol building presented an unprecedented and dangerous situation for those in the Capitol building, those in law enforcement, and for American democracy as a whole.\"\n\nDespite the ban, some of Trump's statements continued to achieve broad dissemination across social networks. Emerson Brooking, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, noted, \"Trump's statements are still being amplified by other popular accounts. His messaging is not disappearing from the online conversation.\"\n\nAn analysis of Trump's social media engagement revealed a dramatic drop in likes and shares after his ban. However, some statements post-ban matched or exceeded pre-ban median engagement. Brooking commented, \"Trump's ban has certainly reduced the spread of his messages, but it hasn't eliminated it entirely.\"\n\nOther social media accounts and right-leaning platforms, such as Parler and Gab, have continued to amplify Trump's messages. A Parler spokesperson stated, \"We believe in free speech and the right to a platform for all voices, regardless of political affiliation.\"\n\nTrump's criticism of conservatives, like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, attracted attention from both left and right-leaning accounts, highlighting the polarized political climate. The Global Disinformation Index classified hundreds of accounts sharing Trump's statements to study political leanings and disinformation spread.\n\nClaims of widespread election fraud by Trump before the social media bans received significantly more engagement than similar claims made after the bans. Disinformation researchers highlighted the impact of deplatforming in reducing the spread of political misinformation and the influence of harmful individuals.\n\nBrooking emphasized, \"While Trump's ban has been effective in limiting his direct reach, it's important to remember that deplatforming is not a silver bullet. It's just one tool in the fight against disinformation and online harm.\"\n\nNow, Trump's role has shifted to that of a 'digital leader-in-exile', influencing discussions indirectly through his statements. His ban has sparked debates on free speech, censorship, and the role of social media in shaping public discourse. Brooking concluded, \"Trump's ban is a complex issue with far-reaching implications. It's not just about one man or one platform; it's about the future of online communication and democracy itself.\""}

Andrew Cuomo, is now under scrutiny as the governor faces accusations of undercounting COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes. After the controversy emerged last year, CNN imposed a policy that barred Chris Cuomo from interviewing or covering stories related to his brother.\n\nIn a statement to The Associated Press, CNN said: \"Chris Cuomo is currently not involved in covering his brother's administration as part of CNN's coverage of New York.\"\n\nThe Cuomo brothers' interviews last spring, characterized by their lighthearted banter, are now criticized as inappropriate. \"There's a conflict of interest any time a journalist has a family member who's a public figure,\" said Roy Gutterman, a media law professor at Syracuse University. \"It creates the perception that there are stories that might not be covered or questions that might not be asked.\"\n\nCritics argue that Chris Cuomo's interviews with his brother created an appearance of preferential treatment, making it unlikely that tough questions would be asked. The Cuomo administration is accused of undercounting COVID-19 deaths of nursing home residents to avoid blame for policies. New York Attorney General Letitia James reported the administration's undercounting of deaths.\n\nAn aide to Andrew Cuomo admitted they withheld the true nursing home death toll out of fear it would be used against them by the Trump administration. \"We froze. We froze on that data,\" Melissa DeRosa told Democratic lawmakers in a virtual meeting last week. \"We were in a position where we weren't sure if what we were going to give to the Department of Justice, or what we give to you guys, what's going to be used against us, and we weren't going to jeopardize that relationship.\"\n\nCNN has covered the nursing home death scandal on programs other than Chris Cuomo's. Anchors like Jake Tapper have openly invited the governor to respond. Tapper criticized Governor Cuomo for a bad decision that may have cost lives and accused his administration of hiding data.\n\nIn a statement to The Associated Press, Chris Cuomo defended his interviews with his brother, saying they were significant and entertaining. \"As I've said on my show, I'm an open book, and so is my family,\" he said. \"We've talked about these issues in the past on my show. Going forward, I will continue to report on the facts and let the politics play out as politics usually does.\"\n\nHowever, Chris Cuomo has followed CNN's policy to not cover related scandals.

It's happening here, in the United States.\"\n\nA recurring theme in the emotional testimonies was the fragility of America's democracy and the critical state of the nation. \"I'm scared for the future of this country,\" wrote one user. \"We can't let this stand. We need to come together and fight for what's right.\"\n\nMany demanded accountability for both Trump and complicit lawmakers, as well as action to restore democracy. \"This is not a partisan issue,\" wrote one user. \"This is about upholding the rule of law and protecting our democracy. It's time for action, not words.\"\n\nThe violence at the Capitol was just the latest in a series of incidents that have tested the resilience of America's democracy. From the violent clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville to the storming of the Michigan State Capitol, many have expressed concern about the direction the country is heading in.\n\nThe events of January 6 have only added to those concerns. \"This is not who we are,\" wrote one user. \"But it's who we've become. And it's up to us to change that.\"\n\nAs the nation grapples with the aftermath of the Capitol riot, many are calling for unity and action. \"We need to come together as a country and work to heal the wounds that have been inflicted,\" wrote one user. \"It won't be easy, but it's the only way forward.\"\n\nIn the days and weeks to come, the focus will be on holding those responsible for the violence accountable and working to restore democracy. But for many, the events of January 6 will serve as a reminder of the fragility of the American experiment and the critical need for vigilance and action."}

The impact was particularly significant in countries where these platforms are essential for communication, business, and daily life.\n\nIn Brazil, where WhatsApp is installed on an astonishing 99% of smartphones, the outage caused widespread panic. Nelzy Mireille, an unemployed woman from Sao Paulo, shared her concerns, \"I depend on WhatsApp for everything, from my job search to staying in touch with my family. When it went down, I felt like I was completely cut off.\"\n\nThe consequences of the outage were even more severe in Haiti, where WhatsApp is a lifeline for many. Wilkens Bourgogne, a user from Port-au-Prince, explained, \"We use WhatsApp to communicate about safety, money transfers, and to connect with our relatives, especially during times of gang violence. The outage left us feeling helpless and vulnerable.\"\n\nIn war-torn Syria, WhatsApp is a crucial communication tool among healthcare workers and for emergency alerts in rebel-held territories.

The cyberattack, attributed to the DarkSide ransomware group, forced the shutdown of one of the country's most critical energy infrastructure networks.\n\nColonial Pipeline, a 5,500-mile network that transports roughly 45% of the East Coast's fuel supply, resumed operations on May 13 after reportedly paying a $5 million ransom in bitcoin to the hackers. The incident served as a stark reminder of the growing threat posed by cybercriminals to the nation's critical infrastructure.\n\n\"The Colonial Pipeline attack underscores the importance of securing our nation's critical infrastructure against cyber threats,\" said Aaron Shilts, CEO of NetSPI, a cybersecurity firm. \"As more infrastructure is digitized, the risk of cyberattacks will only grow.\"\n\nPrivate equity firms, including KKR & Co., have long recognized the potential of infrastructure investments. In 2010, KKR acquired a 23.4% stake in Colonial Pipeline for approximately $750 million. This investment underscores private equity's interest in infrastructure, particularly midstream companies, which offer predictable cash flows.\n\nHowever, the energy sector has seen a decrease in private equity investments in recent years. According to Prequin, total private equity deal value in the energy sector declined by 33% in 2020 compared to 2019. Despite this trend, midstream companies remain attractive due to their essential role in the energy value chain and the predictability of their cash flows.\n\nKKR has been active in pipeline investments, forming a joint venture with Williams Companies to invest in midstream infrastructure projects and acquiring stakes in various midstream projects such as the Mountain Valley Pipeline and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The firm is now raising capital for a new infrastructure fund, targeting $12 billion.\n\nThe global demand for oil is expected to continue growing into the 2030s, ensuring ongoing investments in oil and gas pipelines. According to the International Energy Agency, global oil demand is projected to reach 103.5 million barrels per day by 2030, up from 97.5 million barrels per day in 2019.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline attack also served as a reminder of the financial impacts of ransomware attacks, which have become increasingly frequent. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, global ransomware damages are projected to reach $20 billion in 2021, up from $11.5 billion in 2019.\n\nFollowing the Colonial attack, KKR led a $90 million investment in NetSPI, a cybersecurity company that specializes in penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. The investment will help NetSPI expand its offerings and better serve its clients in the face of growing cybersecurity threats.\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate development, Ginkgo Bioworks announced one of the biggest Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) deals ever, with a $17.5 billion post-money valuation. The Boston-based biotech firm will use the proceeds to expand its synthetic biology platform and invest in new areas such as industrial biotechnology and agriculture.\n\n\"The Colonial Pipeline attack underscores the importance of investing in both infrastructure and cybersecurity,\" Shilts said. \"As more infrastructure is digitized, securing it against cyber threats will become increasingly critical.\""}

The jury consists of nine white and six Black or multiracial members, a rarity in Minnesota courts.\n\nTrahern Crews, organizer and spokesperson for Black Lives Matter in Minnesota, expressed optimism about the jury's diversity, stating, \"This is a significant moment for our community. The fact that the jury reflects the demographics of the city is a positive sign. It shows that the system is starting to listen and respond to our demands for justice.\"\n\nExperts have long advocated for greater jury diversity, arguing that it brings different perspectives and may challenge biases. Mary Moriarty, former chief public defender for Hennepin County, highlighted the underrepresentation of Black people in Hennepin County juries, stating, \"It's crucial that juries reflect the community they serve. The lack of representation of Black people in juries has long been a concern, and this trial represents an important step towards addressing that issue.\"\n\nChauvin is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for over nine minutes, leading to Floyd's death on May 25, 2020. The incident sparked worldwide protests and calls for racial justice.\n\nDuring jury selection, potential members were questioned about their views on race, policing, and the protests following Floyd's death. Two Black men selected for the jury shared personal concerns about racial discrimination and its impact. One juror, who wished to remain anonymous, stated, \"George Floyd's death hit me hard. I've experienced discrimination myself, and I can't imagine what his family is going through. I'm here to make sure that justice is served.\"\n\nFloyd family attorney Ben Crump emphasized the role of race in Floyd's death and the quest for justice. \"George Floyd's death was a result of systemic racism and police brutality. The fact that this jury is diverse is an important step towards ensuring a fair trial. We will continue to fight for justice for George and his family.\"\n\nJury diversity has played a significant role in past trial outcomes involving police officers. In 2015, a jury in St. Louis, Missouri, acquitted former police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown, a Black teenager. The jury was all-white, sparking widespread protests and accusations of racial bias. In contrast, the jury in the 2013 trial of George Zimmerman, who was acquitted in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a Black teenager, included five Black members.\n\nAs the trial progresses, the eyes of the world will be on the jury's verdict. The outcome of this trial has the potential to set a precedent for future cases involving police officers and racial discrimination. The hope is that the unprecedented jury diversity in the Chauvin trial will lead to a fair and unbiased verdict that brings justice for George Floyd and his family.\n\nMoriarty emphasized the importance of continued efforts to increase jury diversity, stating, \"This trial represents an important step, but we cannot rest on our laurels. We must continue to push for greater representation of Black people in juries and in the criminal justice system as a whole.\"\n\nCrump added, \"This trial is just the beginning. We must continue to fight for systemic change and address the root causes of racial discrimination and police brutality.\"\n\nCrews concluded, \"We will continue to demand justice for George Floyd and all Black lives lost to police brutality and systemic racism. This trial is an important step, but our work is far from over.\"\n\nThe trial of Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd marks a pivotal moment in the quest for racial justice in the United States. The unprecedented jury diversity in this trial has raised hopes for a fair and unbiased verdict, but the fight for systemic change continues. The eyes of the world are on this trial, and the outcome has the potential to set a precedent for future cases involving police officers and racial discrimination. The hope is that justice will be served for George Floyd and his family, and that this trial will serve as a catalyst for continued efforts to address the root causes of racial discrimination and police brutality."}

Contrary to expectations based on previous protests, the officers showed an unprecedented level of restraint amidst the chaos and violence that unfolded at the U.S. Capitol. However, a new report by Capitol Police Inspector General Michael A. Bolton reveals significant failures in intelligence, equipment readiness, and operational preparedness by Capitol Police leadership.\n\nIn his scathing report, Inspector General Bolton criticized the Capitol Police force for not adequately preparing for the Jan. 6 riot, despite receiving multiple warnings of a potential threat to Congress. Bolton stated, \"Despite intelligence reporting that indicated the potential for mass protest attendance and the possibility of violence and disruption, the Metropolitan Police Department and the United States Capitol Police did not have sufficient staffing, equipment, or plans for barricading and controlling the crowd.\"\n\nFormer Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who resigned following the riot, claimed that a lack of intelligence predicted the riot's scale. However, Bolton's findings contradict this claim. The report reveals that the FBI and Department of Homeland Security had issued warnings about potential violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, yet these warnings were ignored or underestimated by Capitol Police leadership.\n\nThe report also critiques the leadership for not allowing the use of heavier less-lethal weapons and for the lack of standards for equipment. Bolton stated, \"The Department does not have a standard for less-lethal munitions, such as tear gas or rubber bullets, or for the deployment of such munitions. The Department's policy is to allow the use of less-lethal munitions only when less-lethal means are insufficient to address the situation.\"\n\nThe report further highlights issues with police equipment, such as shields that shattered upon impact due to improper storage. Bolton emphasized the importance of \"ensuring that the Department's equipment is well-maintained, adequate, and properly stored.\"\n\nThe Inspector General's findings call for deep reforms within the Capitol Police department and its culture. Discussions and comparisons have arisen regarding the perceived difference in police response to the Capitol riot versus Black Lives Matter protests. While some argue that the Capitol Police showed too much restraint during the riot, others criticize the heavy-handed response to peaceful protests throughout 2020. Bolton's report sheds light on the complex issues surrounding law enforcement and the need for improved preparedness and response to potential threats.\n\nIn conclusion, the Capitol Police Inspector General's report provides a comprehensive critique of the Capitol Police force's preparation and response to the Jan. 6 riot.

The charges stemmed from Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden in exchange for military aid and a White House visit. While the evidence of this scheme was clear, the Republican-led Senate, in February 2020, voted not to remove Trump from office.\n\nFast-forward to the present, and we find Trump once again attempting to manipulate an electoral outcome, this time in Georgia. In a phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, Trump urged him to \"find\" enough votes to overturn Joe Biden's victory, echoing his dealings with Ukraine. Trump's blatant disregard for the democratic process and the Constitution raises serious concerns about his ongoing efforts to subvert the will of the American people.\n\nDavid A. Graham, a senior editor at The Atlantic, suggests that Trump's behavior is not an isolated incident but a consistent pattern. The president's actions reflect a deep-rooted desire to manipulate electoral outcomes to his benefit, regardless of the cost to our democracy.\n\nThe consequences of the Senate's failure to remove Trump from office in early 2020 are becoming increasingly clear. In the absence of accountability, Trump feels emboldened to continue his attempts to undermine the integrity of the electoral process. Legal experts are unsure if Trump could face criminal liability for his actions concerning Georgia's election results, but the impeachment process was seen as the appropriate mechanism for holding a president accountable.\n\nRegrettably, only one Republican senator, Mitt Romney, voted to convict Trump during his impeachment trial. The Republican response to Trump's behaviors and claims has been largely supportive or evasive, further damaging the already fragile trust in our democratic institutions. The lack of consequences for Trump's actions sets a dangerous precedent for future political misconduct, potentially eroding the very foundations of our electoral system.\n\nThis pattern of impunity is not only detrimental to our democracy but also sends a chilling message to future presidents and political leaders. It indicates that they, too, can act with impunity, using their power to manipulate elections and subvert the democratic process. This is a path we cannot afford to tread, as the cost to our democracy could be irreparable.\n\nAs we move forward, it is crucial that we hold those in power accountable for their actions. We cannot allow the erosion of our democratic institutions to continue unchecked. The impeachment process, while not perfect, is a vital tool in ensuring that our leaders uphold the values and principles upon which our country was founded. We must demand better from our elected officials and hold them accountable for their actions, no matter who they are or which party they represent.\n\nIn conclusion, the Senate's failure to remove Trump from office in 2020 has emboldened him to continue his efforts to manipulate electoral outcomes. The precedent set by his actions could have far-reaching consequences for our democracy. It is essential that we remain vigilant and insist on accountability from our elected officials. The future of our democracy depends on it."}

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and other Republicans argued that the commission would politically damage their party and was unnecessary.\n\nSchumer voiced his disappointment, stating, \"Republicans have chosen to side with the insurrectionists. They want to cover up what happened on January 6.\"\n\nMcConnell, however, argued, \"The proposed commission would interfere with ongoing law enforcement investigations, and it would set a horrible precedent for future administrations.\"\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), a vocal Trump supporter, warned her fellow Republicans that the commission would be used to smear Trump supporters.

It would have been bipartisan, with equal representation from Republicans and Democrats. Thirty-five House Republicans supported the legislation, but it lacked enough Republican support in the Senate.\n\nGladys Sicknick, the mother of deceased Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, spoke out in support of the commission, stating, \"My son gave his life protecting the Capitol and the democratic process. The American people deserve to know what happened that day, and I believe an independent, bipartisan commission is the best way to get those answers.\"\n\nWith the Senate's rejection of the bill, there are calls for a select congressional committee to investigate the January 6 breach. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has indicated her support for such a committee.\n\nDespite the setback, Schumer vowed to continue pushing for accountability, stating, \"We will not give up. We will not rest until we get to the bottom of what happened on January 6 and ensure that those responsible are held accountable.\"\n\nSenate Majority Whip Richard Durbin (D-IL) echoed Schumer's sentiment, stating, \"This is not the end of the story. We will continue to fight for transparency and accountability.\"\n\nRepublicans, however, remain steadfast in their opposition. McConnell stated, \"We don't need a commission to tell us what we already know. The events of January 6 were a disgrace, and those responsible should be held accountable. But we don't need a partisan commission to tell us that.\"\n\nAs the debate over the January 6 commission continues, both parties remain deeply divided over the need for accountability and the role of politics in the investigation.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Senate's rejection of the bill, Democrats and some moderate Republicans expressed their frustration and disappointment. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) stated, \"I believe an independent, bipartisan commission is the best way to get to the bottom of what happened on January 6. I'm deeply disappointed that we weren't able to get the necessary votes today.\"\n\nSenator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) also voiced her support for the commission, stating, \"We need to find out what happened on January 6 and hold those responsible accountable. An independent, bipartisan commission is the best way to do that.\"\n\nAs the debate over the January 6 commission continues, both parties remain deeply divided over the need for accountability and the role of politics in the investigation. The rejection of the bill in the Senate has left many calling for a select congressional committee to take up the investigation, but it remains to be seen whether such a committee will be able to garner the necessary bipartisan support.\n\nIn the meantime, the events of January 6 continue to cast a long shadow over American politics, with both parties seemingly unable to find common ground on the need for accountability and the role of politics in the investigation. The debate over the January 6 commission is just the latest chapter in a story that is far from over.\n\nSchumer summed up the situation, stating, \"We will not give up. We will not rest until we get to the bottom of what happened on January 6 and ensure that those responsible are held accountable. The American people deserve the truth.\"\n\nAs the debate over the January 6 commission continues, both parties remain deeply divided over the need for accountability and the role of politics in the investigation. With the Senate's rejection of the bill, the future of the investigation remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the events of January 6 continue to cast a long shadow over American politics, and the need for transparency and accountability has never been greater."}

Dr. Mikael Dolsten, who leads worldwide research, development, and medical for Pfizer, announced the findings during the company's earnings call on Wednesday.\n\nDuring the call, Dolsten highlighted the potential high increase in neutralizing antibodies post third dose, stating, \"What we're seeing is really quite striking. In the 18 to 55 age group, there's about a fivefold increase in antibody levels. In the older adult population, 65 to 85, it's about an 11-fold increase.\"\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the study involved tests on only 23 people, and the data have not been peer-reviewed or published. Still, the news sparked excitement in the scientific community regarding the potential for increased protection against the Delta variant.\n\nNew safety and efficacy data from Pfizer indicate the vaccine's overall efficacy stands at about 91% for up to six months after the second dose. The company plans to submit data for emergency use authorization of a third dose to the FDA as early as next month.\n\nDr. Vivek Murthy, the US Surgeon General, reaffirmed during a press briefing on Thursday that people do not need a booster shot at this moment. \"The FDA and CDC have not yet approved booster shots for the general public,\" Murthy stated. \"The current vaccines continue to provide strong protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death from Covid-19.\"\n\nQuestions remain about the correlation between antibody levels and real-world immunity, as well as the role of other parts of the immune system. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, emphasized the importance of considering multiple factors when evaluating the need for booster shots. \"Antibody levels are just one piece of the puzzle,\" Fauci said in a statement. \"We also need to consider the durability of T-cell responses and other immune system mechanisms.\"\n\nThe debate continues over the ethics of administering booster shots in developed countries while there is a vaccine shortage in the developing world. The World Health Organization has called for a moratorium on booster shots until at least 10% of the global population is fully vaccinated.\n\nDr. Mariana Castillo-Mendez, the WHO's Assistant Director-General for Universal Health Coverage and Access, expressed concern during a press briefing on Thursday. \"We cannot allow countries to use up the entire global supply of vaccines for booster shots while the majority of the world remains unvaccinated,\" Castillo-Mendez stated.\n\nMeanwhile, Pfizer and other vaccine manufacturers are working to address the global vaccine shortage. Moderna has announced plans to donate 300 million doses to low- and middle-income countries, and Johnson & Johnson has pledged to supply an additional 200 million doses to Covax, the global vaccine-sharing initiative.\n\nIn a statement, Pfizer emphasized its commitment to addressing the global vaccine shortage. \"We are working closely with governments and global health organizations to ensure equitable distribution of our vaccine,\" a Pfizer spokesperson said. \"We believe that a world protected from Covid-19 is in everyone's best interest.\"\n\nAs the world continues to grapple with the pandemic, the race to develop and distribute effective vaccines remains a top priority. The latest data from Pfizer and other vaccine manufacturers offer hope for increased protection against the Delta variant and other emerging Covid-19 strains. However, the ethical considerations and real-world implications of booster shots will continue to be topics of intense debate in the coming months.\n\nIn the words of Dr. Mikael Dolsten, \"We are in this together, and we must continue to work collaboratively to ensure that everyone, everywhere, has access to the tools they need to protect themselves and their communities from Covid-19.\""}

However, determining the length of Chauvin's sentence carries its own uncertainties.\n\nUnder Minnesota law, Chauvin will only be sentenced for the most serious charge, second-degree murder, which has a maximum sentence of 40 years. But experts predict Chauvin is unlikely to receive the maximum sentence.\n\nMary Moriarty, a former Hennepin County chief public defender, stated, \"It's really hard to imagine that he's going to get the maximum sentence.\"\n\nKeith Ellison, Minnesota Attorney General, acknowledged the potential for a lengthy sentence during a press conference: \"The law says he could get up to 40 years... I'm not going to speculate.\"\n\nMark Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, added, \"It's rare for someone to get the maximum sentence.\" He explained that sentencing guidelines are more likely to influence the outcome.\n\nMinnesota's sentencing guidelines suggest a presumptive sentence of 12 1/2 years for someone with no criminal record, like Chauvin. However, the prosecution is seeking an 'upward departure' from the guidelines due to aggravating factors such as Floyd's vulnerability and the presence of children during the crime.\n\nOsler explained, \"The expectation is that an upward departure sentence should not exceed double the guideline range.\" That would mean a maximum sentence of 25 years.\n\nChauvin can expect to serve two-thirds of his sentence in prison with good behavior, the rest potentially on supervised release. Moriarty emphasized the importance of behavior during incarceration, stating, \"The way that person behaves in prison can make a big difference in the length of time they spend in prison.\"\n\nBoth defense and prosecution will submit briefs on aggravating factors, which will influence Judge Cahill's sentencing decision. Ted Sampsell-Jones, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, noted, \"Judges are not bound by those sentencing guidelines, but they do use them as a guideline.\"\n\nA pre-sentence investigation report, typically including personal history and the offense's impact, will also be considered in the sentencing. Moriarty stressed, \"The pre-sentence investigation is a very important part of the sentencing process.\"\n\nRegarding Chauvin's potential statement during the sentencing hearing, Sampsell-Jones said, \"There's a good chance he won't say anything... Because anything he says could be used against him in an appeal.\"\n\nEllison expressed confidence in the justice system's ability to deliver an appropriate sentence: \"The jury's verdict was just the first step.

The unusual severity of this weather event raises questions about its connection to climate change.\n\nAccording to Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado Boulder, the cold snap was \"controversial\" among scientists when it comes to climate change. Meier explained, \"There's a debate in the scientific community about whether global warming increases or decreases the likelihood of extreme cold events.\"\n\nQuote from Walt Meier: \"There's a debate in the scientific community about whether global warming increases or decreases the likelihood of extreme cold events.\"\n\nKarin Gleason, a climate scientist at the National Centers for Environmental Information at NOAA, argues that while global warming may not directly cause extreme cold events, it could make them less frequent or less severe in some regions. However, she warns that the Arctic's rapid warming could result in more frequent cold spells further south.\n\nQuote from Karin Gleason: \"Global warming doesn't cause extreme cold events, but the Arctic's rapid warming could lead to more frequent cold spells further south.\"\n\nJennifer Francis, a senior scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, points out that the recent cold event aligns with predictions that such extreme weather will become more common in a warming climate. She notes that extreme heat and cold can co-exist due to the meandering jet stream.\n\nQuote from Jennifer Francis: \"Extreme heat and cold can co-exist due to the meandering jet stream.\"\n\nJames Screen, an associate professor of climate science at the University of Exeter, expresses skepticism about a direct link between climate change and increased extreme cold events. He believes that other factors, such as sudden stratospheric warming and variations in the Arctic Oscillation, played significant roles in the recent cold weather.\n\nQuote from James Screen: \"I'm skeptical of a direct link between climate change and increased extreme cold events.\"\n\nSudden stratospheric warming occurs when the stratosphere warms rapidly, leading to a disruption in the polar vortex that can result in cold air being transported to mid-latitude regions. Variations in the Arctic Oscillation, an atmospheric pressure pattern, can also influence weather patterns and contribute to extreme cold events.\n\nThe Arctic is warming at a rate of approximately twice that of the rest of the planet, a phenomenon with uncertain implications for extreme weather patterns. Some researchers suggest that the Arctic's rapid warming could lead to more frequent and intense polar vortex disruptions, potentially increasing the likelihood of extreme cold events in mid-latitude regions.\n\nMeier acknowledges the controversy surrounding the link between climate change and extreme cold events but emphasizes the importance of continued research to better understand these complex relationships. He explains, \"It's a controversial topic, but it's essential that we continue to study these events and their potential connections to climate change.\"\n\nQuote from Walt Meier: \"It's a controversial topic, but it's essential that we continue to study these events and their potential connections to climate change.\"\n\nGleason agrees that more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between climate change and extreme cold events. She encourages the public to remain informed about the latest scientific findings and to take action to reduce their carbon footprint to mitigate the impacts of climate change.\n\nQuote from Karin Gleason: \"More research is needed to fully understand the relationship between climate change and extreme cold events.\"\n\nFrancis emphasizes the importance of preparing for extreme weather events, regardless of their potential connection to climate change. She encourages individuals, communities, and governments to invest in infrastructure and emergency response plans to minimize the impacts of extreme weather events.\n\nThe extreme cold event caused by Winter Storm Uri had far-reaching consequences, including massive power outages and billions of dollars in damages. While the scientific community continues to debate the potential link between climate change and extreme cold events, it is clear that extreme weather will remain a significant challenge in the coming years.\n\nAs the world grapples with the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, it is essential that scientists, policymakers, and the public work together to better understand these complex phenomena and take action to mitigate their impacts. The ongoing debate about the relationship between climate change and extreme cold events highlights the importance of continued research and open dialogue in addressing the challenges posed by a changing climate.\n\nQuote from Jennifer Francis: \"As the world grapples with the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, it is essential that scientists, policymakers, and the public work together to better understand these complex phenomena and take action to mitigate their impacts.\""}

According to Steve Bowen, head of catastrophe insight at insurer Aon, \"Hurricane Ida was the costliest tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin's recorded history.\"\n\nThe destructive power of Ida was felt across multiple U.S. states, with deadly winds ravaging Louisiana and catastrophic flooding inundating New York. This extreme weather event served as a stark reminder of the escalating costs and human toll wrought by climate change.\n\nJoining Ida in the annals of 2021's billion-dollar disasters was Texas' severe ice storm in February, which claimed over 111 lives and resulted in financial losses surpassing $20 billion.\n\nIn total, the top 10 climate-change disasters of 2021 amassed at least $170 billion in costs, according to data from various insurers and reinsurers. This figure underscores the ever-growing threat posed by extreme weather events fueled by a warming planet.\n\nThe 2021 tally represents a 13% increase in financial costs from global natural disasters compared to the previous year. Swiss Re, one of the world's leading reinsurers, reported $250 billion in damages from natural and extreme weather events in the past year, a 24% increase over the previous year.\n\nBowen noted, \"The frequency, intensity, and cost of natural disasters are increasingly linked to climate change. We are seeing more extreme weather events and that trend is likely to continue.\"\n\nThe challenge of accurately quantifying losses from climate disasters in underinsured nations or those with poor record-keeping was highlighted in a recent report by Christian Aid. According to the report, \"Estimating the financial impact of climate disasters in vulnerable countries can be a complex and challenging process.\"\n\nDespite these mounting challenges, the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow made significant strides in cutting methane emissions and saw increased private-sector involvement in climate action.\n\n\"The Glasgow Climate Pact represents a crucial step forward in the global response to the climate crisis,\" said Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\nAt COP26, over 100 countries pledged to reduce methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030. This commitment is significant as methane, a potent greenhouse gas, accounts for about 25% of human-caused global warming.\n\nThe private sector's role in climate action was further emphasized by the launch of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), which aims to help its members transition their investment portfolios to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\n\"The insurance industry plays a crucial role in managing the financial risks associated with climate change,\" said NZIA CEO Mark Wilson. \"Through the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance, we are taking concrete steps to reduce our sector's carbon footprint and support the transition to a low-carbon economy.\"\n\nThe NZIA's commitment to net-zero emissions is an essential component of the broader effort to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n\nBowen added, \"The insurance industry has a critical role to play in helping societies adapt to the impacts of climate change and build more resilient communities.\"\n\nCOP26 also saw the launch of the Global Shield Against Climate Risks, an initiative aimed at providing climate risk insurance to vulnerable populations in developing countries. This initiative is a testament to the growing recognition that climate action must be inclusive and address the needs of those most at risk.\n\nThe Global Shield Against Climate Risks is expected to provide coverage for up to 400 million people in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, with a potential payout of $4 billion per year.\n\n\"The Global Shield Against Climate Risks is a game-changer in the fight against climate change,\" said UN Secretary-General António Guterres. \"It will help protect the most vulnerable communities from the devastating impacts of extreme weather events.\"\n\nAs the world grapples with the ever-increasing threat of billion-dollar climate disasters, it is crucial that we continue to make progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building a more resilient future.\n\nBowen emphasized, \"We need to act now to reduce our carbon footprint and build more resilient communities. The cost of inaction is simply too high.\""}

Around 100 students gathered near the university's Memorial Union on Tuesday, chanting \"Killer Kyle off our campus\" and questioning his admission based on his trial and charges.\n\nZein Hajaig, an ASU freshman and attendee of the protest, shared his concerns about Rittenhouse's potential presence on campus, stating, \"ASU prides itself on being an inclusive and diverse community. Having someone like Kyle Rittenhouse, who has been accused of taking an innocent life, goes against everything we stand for.\"\n\nASU spokesman Jay Thorne addressed the situation, clarifying that Rittenhouse is not currently enrolled and has not gone through the admissions process. Thorne added that criminal history is not considered during the admissions process for online classes, emphasizing that anyone qualified can apply for admission. Thorne also mentioned that a guilty verdict would not prevent Rittenhouse from being a student.\n\nProtesters, however, were not satisfied with the university's response, demanding ASU to prevent Rittenhouse's re-enrollment, denounce white supremacy, and support multicultural spaces. Student organizations, including the Black Student Union and the ASU Progressive Student Alliance, issued statements condemning the potential enrollment of Rittenhouse.\n\nAn online petition against Rittenhouse attending ASU has gathered over 15,000 signatures as of press time. The petition, started by ASU alumna Elizabeth Renteria, calls on the university administration to take a stand against hate and intolerance on campus.\n\nRittenhouse, who expressed a desire to pursue a career in nursing and attend classes on campus in various media interviews, has yet to publicly respond to the protests and calls for his exclusion from ASU.\n\nFormer Republican Rep. Matt Salmon, a vocal critic of the protest, urged respect for the judicial system and the rule of law. \"It's important to remember that Kyle Rittenhouse was found not guilty by a jury of his peers. We cannot allow mob mentality to dictate who can and cannot attend a university,\" Salmon said in a statement.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, tensions remain high on the ASU campus, with an equal number of Rittenhouse supporters present at the counter-protest, some displaying support for Republican candidates. The debate surrounding Rittenhouse's potential enrollment in ASU raises larger questions about the role of universities in accepting students with controversial backgrounds and the importance of upholding the principles of due process and free speech."}

He was transported to a local hospital by ambulance.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that Woods sustained a shattered ankle and two leg fractures, one of which was compound. The compound fracture refers to the bone protruding through the skin.\n\nSheriff Alex Villanueva noted during the press conference that speed appeared to be a factor in the crash, which involved Woods' vehicle hitting a center divider and several rollovers. \"The primary cause of the single-vehicle collision was driving at a high rate of speed,\" Villanueva stated. However, there was no evidence of impairment or intoxication from Woods at the time of the crash.\n\nMark Steinberg, Woods' manager, issued a statement saying, \"Tiger Woods was in a single-car accident this morning in California.

The 9 minutes and 29 seconds were broken down into three sections: 2 minutes and 56 seconds with Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck, 1 minute and 53 seconds with Chauvin's knee on Floyd's back, and 5 minutes and 20 seconds with Chauvin's legs pinning Floyd to the ground.\n\nEric Nelson, Chauvin's defense attorney, acknowledged the corrected timing in his opening statement, stating, \"You will hear evidence that any use of force by officer Chauvin was not a causative factor in the death of Mr. Floyd.\"\n\nDespite the change in the timing, the earlier 8 minutes and 46 seconds has become culturally significant, inspiring protests, moments of silence, and creative works around the world. Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, and other family members have publicly commemorated the 8 minutes and 46 seconds.\n\nThe Hennepin County Attorney's Office has corrected the timing on several occasions. Initially, the error was attributed to the timing of the viral bystander video that captured the altercation.\n\n\"The initial reports were based on a preliminary investigation. Once we received the full autopsy report, we were able to calculate the actual time of the restraint,\" said Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County Attorney, in a press conference.\n\nThe revelation of the 9 minutes and 29 seconds came as a surprise to many, but the altercation in the trial was less about the timing difference and more about the extensive evidence presented, including medical testimony, eyewitness accounts, and body camera footage.\n\n\"This is not about a few seconds,\" Blackwell stated. \"It's about what was done to Mr. Floyd for 9 minutes and 29 seconds.\"\n\nNelson argued that the revised timing does not change the outcome of the case. \"The focus should be on the evidence, not the timing,\" he said.\n\nAs the trial continues, the attention remains on the facts of the case and the role of Chauvin's actions in Floyd's death. The significance of the 9 minutes and 29 seconds and its impact on public perception will undoubtedly be a topic of discussion both inside and outside the courtroom."}

This colossal error occurred due to a mistake in executing a transaction within Citibank's software system.\n\nThe funds, intended for an internal \"wash account,\" ended up being sent directly to the creditors due to unmarked checkboxes in Citibank's system. This unintended consequence raised a significant legal question: should the lenders be required to return the mistakenly transferred funds?\n\nSome lenders refused to return the funds, citing New York's \"discharge-for-value\" exception, which stipulates that a creditor is discharged from a debt once they have received payment in good faith and without knowledge that the payment was erroneous.\n\nCitibank initiated a lawsuit to recover the unreturned funds, focusing on whether the lenders knew the payments were a mistake at the time they were made. In this digital age, the court proceedings would hinge on the interpretation of chat messages between the lenders.\n\nChat messages between the lenders became crucial evidence in the case. The timing of these messages was pivotal, as jokes and shocked reactions came after Citibank's attempt to recall the funds. This suggested that the lenders did not initially recognize the mistake.\n\nThe case underscored the importance of complete metadata in interpreting communication accurately. The absence of metadata can lead to ambiguity and misinterpretation, potentially complicating legal proceedings.\n\nThe incident served as a reminder of the potential pitfalls of poorly designed software and user interfaces. Clearer instructions and user-friendly terminology could have prevented the Citibank error, saving all parties from the ensuing legal tussle.\n\nAs more organizations adopt collaboration tools like chat platforms for internal communication, the importance of integrating these messages into corporate ediscovery and information governance workflows becomes increasingly evident.\n\nThe Revlon case underscores the need for organizations to be prepared for ediscovery, especially regarding instant messaging and collaboration platforms. Properly managing and preserving digital communication is essential to minimize potential legal repercussions.\n\nIn the wake of the Revlon mishap, Citibank and other financial institutions must reassess their internal systems to prevent similar occurrences. Regular audits and updates to software and user interfaces can help reduce the risk of errors.\n\nMoreover, this case highlights the importance of having clear policies and procedures for handling errors and communication with counterparties. Having a well-defined response plan can help mitigate the impact of unintended consequences.\n\nThe Revlon case sets a precedent for future legal disputes involving digital communication and financial transactions. Courts will increasingly rely on chat messages, emails, and other digital records to make informed decisions.\n\nTo conclude, the Citibank-Revlon incident serves as a stark reminder of the risks and challenges associated with managing digital communication and financial transactions in today's complex business landscape. It underscores the need for robust information governance strategies, user-friendly software, and a proactive approach to managing digital records."}

The incident occurred on February 22, 2023, after Richards was suspected of shoplifting a toolbox from Walmart and allegedly pulled a knife on an employee.\n\nAccording to the Pima County Attorney's Office, Remington, who has been with the Tucson police department for four years, was working off-duty as Walmart security when the incident took place. He followed Richards from Walmart and called for backup as Richards entered a Lowe's store.\n\nSurveillance and body camera footage from the incident show Remington confronting Richards in the Lowe's parking lot. Richards reportedly did not comply with Remington's commands and turned his wheelchair away from him. Remington then fired the fatal shots.\n\nIn a statement, Chris Magnus, Tucson Police Chief, condemned Remington's actions as a violation of department policy and training in use of force. \"The actions of Officer Remington in this incident are indefensible and a clear violation of TPD policy, training, and ethical standards,\" Magnus said. \"Our department holds its officers to the highest standards of conduct, and we will take swift and decisive action when those standards are not met.\"\n\nMike Storie, attorney for Ryan Remington, claimed that his client had no nonlethal options due to the placement of the wheelchair. \"Officer Remington was in fear for his life and the lives of others due to the actions of Mr. Richards,\" Storie said. \"The placement of the wheelchair made it impossible for Officer Remington to use any nonlethal options, and he was left with no choice but to defend himself and others.\"\n\nTucson Mayor Regina Romero called the actions \"unconscionable and indefensible\" and supports the investigation. \"The actions of Officer Remington are a disgrace and a betrayal of the trust that our community places in our law enforcement officers,\" Romero said. \"I fully support the ongoing investigation by the Pima County Attorney's Office and will hold Officer Remington accountable for his actions.\"\n\nThis incident follows another investigation involving an off-duty Tucson police officer who was involved in a shooting earlier this month. The department is also conducting an internal review of that incident.\n\nThe Pima County Attorney's Office is reviewing the fatal shooting for possible criminal charges against Remington. If charged and convicted, Remington could face felony charges for manslaughter or second-degree murder.\n\nThe shooting has sparked outrage in the community, with many calling for justice for Richards and reforms in the Tucson Police Department. The incident is the latest in a series of high-profile police shootings across the country, raising questions about police use of force and accountability.\n\nRichards' family has hired an attorney and is planning to file a civil lawsuit against the Tucson Police Department and the city of Tucson. The family is seeking damages for wrongful death and emotional distress.\n\nThe Tucson Police Department has launched an internal investigation into the incident and has placed Remington on administrative leave. The department has also offered counseling services to the Richards family and employees who were present during the shooting.\n\nThe shooting has also led to calls for reforms in the Tucson Police Department, with many advocating for more training in de-escalation techniques and use of nonlethal force. The department has announced plans to increase training in these areas and to review its policies on use of force.\n\nIn a statement, Magnus acknowledged the need for reforms in the department. \"We recognize that there is more work to be done to build trust and strengthen the relationship between our department and the community we serve,\" Magnus said. \"We are committed to working with community leaders, advocacy groups, and other stakeholders to address these issues and to make our department the best it can be.\"\n\nThe investigation into the shooting is ongoing, and more information is expected to be released in the coming days and weeks. The Tucson Police Department and the Pima County Attorney's Office are urging anyone with information about the incident to come forward and contact the department or the attorney's office.\n\nIn the meantime, the Richards family is grieving the loss of their loved one and calling for justice. \"My father did not deserve to die like this,\" said Richards' daughter, Sarah. \"He was a kind and gentle man who didn't deserve to be treated this way by the very people who are supposed to protect and serve our community.\"\n\nThe shooting has also raised questions about the role of off-duty officers working in retail settings and the potential for conflicts of interest. The Tucson Police Department has announced plans to review its policies on off-duty work and to provide additional training and resources to officers working in these roles.\n\nThe incident has also highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in police use of force. The Tucson Police Department and the Pima County Attorney's Office have pledged to release more information about the shooting and the investigation as it becomes available.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the Tucson community is left to grapple with the implications of the shooting and to call for reforms in the police department and in the broader criminal justice system."}

Showrunner Alexi Hawley made the announcement in a letter to the cast and crew, emphasizing the importance of cast and crew safety.\n\n\"Following the tragic incident on the set of 'Rust,' we have made the decision to prohibit the use of live weapons on 'The Rookie,'\" Hawley wrote in the letter, obtained by CNN. \"Effective immediately, all weapons used on our set will be airsoft guns. Post-production effects will be added as needed.\"\n\nThe decision to ban live weapons was influenced by the incident on the \"Rust\" set, where cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed and director Joel Souza was injured when a prop gun discharged.\n\nBen Simmons, a weapons expert who has worked on various film and television productions, categorizes prop guns into three categories: fake, deactivated, and real firearms. He stressed the importance of using deactivated or fake weapons on set.\n\n\"When it comes to using real firearms on set, it's a huge risk,\" Simmons said. \"There's always a chance that something could go wrong, and the consequences can be devastating.\"\n\nHawley echoed Simmons' sentiments in his letter to the cast and crew. \"Our priority is the safety and well-being of everyone who works on 'The Rookie,'\" he wrote.\n\nCNN reached out to ABC and \"The Rookie\" representatives for comment on the new safety measures but did not receive a response at the time of publication.\n\nThe investigation into the \"Rust\" shooting incident is still ongoing, and new details continue to emerge. According to reports, Alec Baldwin was told the prop gun was a \"cold gun\" before the fatal shooting. However, assistant director David Halls unknowingly handed Baldwin a gun with live rounds.\n\n\"I would never point a gun at anyone and pull the trigger without knowing it was a cold gun,\" Baldwin said in a statement. \"There were no marks or indication on the gun that it was loaded with live rounds. I relied on the professionals to tell me it was safe to do so.\"\n\nHalls has also spoken out about the incident, expressing his remorse and regret for the tragedy. \"I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I thought I was seeing a prank. I thought it was a joke,\" he said in an interview with ABC News. \"I never, ever, ever wanted anything like this to happen.\"\n\nAs the industry grapples with the aftermath of the \"Rust\" tragedy, productions are implementing new safety measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. \"The Rookie's\" decision to ban live weapons on set is just one example of the industry's renewed focus on cast and crew safety."}

Dr. Albert Ko, an infectious disease specialist at the Yale School of Public Health, expressed solemnly, \"We've reached a number that is beyond comprehension.\"\n\nFour countries - the United States, European Union, Britain, and Brazil - account for nearly half of all reported COVID-19 deaths, despite being high-income nations with access to advanced healthcare systems.\n\nCOVID-19 has become the third leading cause of death globally, surpassing malaria and tuberculosis, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, director of ICAP at Columbia University, emphasized, \"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and worsened existing health and social inequalities around the world.\"\n\nThe actual death toll is believed to be much higher due to limited testing and unreported at-home deaths, particularly in low-income countries.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, countries like Russia and Ukraine are currently among the hardest hit due to vaccination challenges. \"Vaccine hesitancy and unequal distribution of vaccines are fueling the crisis,\" El-Sadr noted.\n\nWealthier nations with older populations have been disproportionately affected, while poorer countries with younger demographics have fared better. Ko explained, \"Age and underlying health conditions are significant risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness and death.\"\n\nWealth disparities within countries also reveal poorer neighborhoods suffering the most. Ko added, \"Social determinants of health, such as access to clean water, adequate housing, and nutritious food, play a crucial role in COVID-19 outcomes.\"\n\nGlobal vaccination efforts exhibit striking inequality, with rich countries beginning booster shots while Africa lags behind. U.N.

Reyerson testified about the timeline of Chauvin's knee placement after Floyd ceased talking and moving. \"After Mr. Floyd went unresponsive, Officer Chauvin kept his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck for an extended period,\" Reyerson stated.\n\nChauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd, who died during an arrest for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill. Fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in Floyd's system, with the defense suggesting drug use and health conditions were the cause of death.\n\nStiger acknowledged that police actions can be \"lawful but awful,\" and discussed the impact of an onlooking crowd perceived as hostile by police. \"The officers are in a difficult position. They're trying to effect an arrest, and there's a crowd there that appears to be hostile,\" Stiger said.\n\nChauvin's lawyer argued that Chauvin's actions should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, not in hindsight. \"Officer Chauvin and the other officers thought Mr. Floyd was still resisting, and they were trying to get him under control,\" Nelson stated.\n\nStiger mentioned that Chauvin used pain compliance techniques on Floyd and didn't ease up despite Floyd's visible distress. \"The officer continued to apply pressure to Mr. Floyd's back and neck area even after Mr. Floyd was no longer responsive,\" Stiger testified.\n\nReyerson also spoke about the officers' attempts to administer medical aid to Floyd. \"Once Mr. Floyd was unresponsive, the officers attempted to provide medical aid,\" Reyerson said.\n\nStiger finished his testimony by stating, \"The amount of force used by Officer Chauvin was not objectively reasonable.\"\n\nNelson cross-examined Stiger, questioning his interpretation of the video and his qualifications as an expert witness.

With a length of 400 meters and a width of 59 meters, the vessel is one of the largest container ships in the world.\n\nEvergreen Marine Corp has leased the Ever Given to add cargo capacity to its East Asia to Europe operations. However, the company refuses to pay any fees if the ship remains stuck in the canal.\n\nEfforts to free the Ever Given have been underway since the incident occurred. Ahmed Mekawy, Deputy Manager of Suez Canal Operations at the GAC Group, reported that some traffic was expected to resume on March 26.\n\nAhmed Mekawy stated, \"We have managed to partially move the Ever Given alongside the bank. However, the process of refloating the ship is still ongoing.\"\n\nThe Suez Canal is a crucial waterway for global trade, connecting the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. The 193km-long canal is the shortest shipping route between Asia and Europe, and about 12% of global trade passes through it, including oil and liquefied natural gas.\n\nAhmed Mekawy further explained, \"The Suez Canal is a vital artery for international trade, and any disruption to its operations can have a ripple effect on the global economy.\"\n\nThe incident was reportedly caused by poor visibility due to a dust storm and strong winds. Dozens of ships were left gridlocked, attempting to transit between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean.\n\nAccording to Evergreen Marine Corp, the Ever Given was carrying about 20,000 containers when it ran aground. The company is working to notify the owners of the containers and arrange for their transportation to their final destinations.\n\nAhmed Mekawy expressed his concern about the economic impact of the incident, stating, \"The longer the Ever Given remains stuck, the more significant the economic consequences will be.\"\n\nEvergreen Marine Corp may seek compensation depending on the investigation's findings on the incident's cause. The company stated that it is cooperating fully with the authorities and will take all necessary steps to minimize the impact on its customers and the global supply chain.\n\nThe shipping industry has been facing challenges in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing competition. The incident in the Suez Canal is another blow to an industry that is already under pressure.\n\nThe Suez Canal Authority is leading the efforts to refloat the Ever Given. The authority has deployed several tugboats, dredgers, and other equipment to the scene.\n\nAhmed Mekawy praised the efforts of the Suez Canal Authority, stating, \"The response from the Suez Canal Authority has been impressive. They have mobilized all available resources to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe Egyptian government has declared a state of emergency in the Suez Canal area to ensure the safety and security of the response efforts. The military has been deployed to assist in the operation.\n\nThe European Commission has expressed its concern about the incident and is monitoring the situation closely. The commission stated that it is in contact with the relevant authorities and is working to minimize the impact on European businesses.\n\nThe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has warned that the incident in the Suez Canal could lead to a short-term increase in freight rates and longer-term supply chain disruptions.\n\nAhmed Mekawy remains optimistic about the situation, stating, \"We are making progress, and I am confident that we will be able to refloat the Ever Given soon.\"\n\nThe incident in the Suez Canal serves as a reminder of the importance of the waterway for global trade and the need for continued investment in infrastructure to ensure its smooth operation. Ahmed Mekawy concluded, \"The Suez Canal is a vital link in the global supply chain, and it is essential that we continue to invest in its maintenance and development to ensure its long-term sustainability.\""}

Michele, who had a suppressed immune system due to her underlying health conditions, spent the past year and a half shielding at home on government advice. Her untimely death has left her family and friends in shock and grief.\n\nMichele's health issues began in her late 20s when she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Over the years, she also developed an underactive thyroid and diabetes. Despite her health struggles, Michele led a vibrant life filled with music, love, and a strong sense of family. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, her health issues forced her into isolation and dependency.\n\nMichele's family is still unsure how she contracted the virus. They speculate that it could have been from a rare visitor or during a doctor's appointment. Her husband, Terry, and daughter, Kim, were unaware of the concept of being 'immunocompromised' until Michele's death.\n\nThe drugs Michele took for her arthritis likely suppressed her immune system, making the vaccine less effective for her. Immunocompromised individuals, such as Michele, are at risk because they may not produce sufficient antibodies in response to vaccination.\n\nMichele was described by her loved ones as a strong, perceptive matriarch with a lively character and a deep bond with her daughter, Kim. The loss of Michele has left a void in their lives that cannot be filled.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine has prevented millions of infections and deaths worldwide. However, its efficacy varies among individuals, especially the immunocompromised. According to the National Health Service (NHS), those with weakened immune systems may not produce a strong enough response to the vaccine.\n\nThe NHS advises that immunocompromised individuals should speak to their healthcare provider about additional measures to protect themselves from COVID-19. These measures may include wearing a mask, social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings.\n\nThe loss of Michele Brown serves as a reminder of the importance of vaccination for those who are able. The vaccine not only protects the individual but also helps to prevent the spread of the virus to others, particularly those who are more vulnerable.\n\nAs the world continues to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to remember the human cost of the virus.

Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, argues several errors occurred during the trial, including jury and prosecutorial misconduct, and a verdict contrary to law.\n\nAccording to the motion, the jury was not adequately shielded from extensive publicity, which could have impacted the trial's fairness. \"The pretrial publicity in this case was pervasive, prejudicial, and affected the jurors' ability to render a fair and impartial verdict,\" the filing states.\n\nNelson also mentions a controversy surrounding juror Brandon Mitchell, who attended a march wearing a shirt that referenced police brutality. The filing demands a hearing to investigate alleged jury misconduct and pressure during deliberations. Mitchell, however, stated the march was attended to support voter turnout, not protests against police brutality.\n\nRachel Moran, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas, believes it's unlikely the verdict will be overturned. \"It's an uphill battle to challenge jury deliberations,\" Moran said. \"The standard is very high, and it's difficult to prove that the jury's verdict was the result of error.\"\n\nThe original jury consisted of a diverse mix of six White, four Black, and two multiracial individuals. Chauvin awaits sentencing, with possible maximum sentences ranging from 10 to 40 years, depending on the charge. Prosecutors have introduced \"aggravating factors\" that could increase Chauvin's sentence, with the hearing scheduled for June 25.\n\nNelson's motion argues that the trial judge, Peter Cahill, erred in several ways. For instance, Cahill allowed the prosecution to present testimony about Chauvin's prior use of force and denied Nelson's request to exclude such evidence. The motion also criticizes the jury instructions and certain aspects of the prosecution's closing arguments.\n\nNelson's filing also raises concerns over potential juror bias. For example, one juror, Brandon Mitchell, attended a march wearing a shirt that read \"Get Your Knee Off Our Necks,\" a reference to Floyd's death. Mitchell told the Star Tribune that the march was attended to support voter turnout, not protests against police brutality. However, the defense argues that this is not credible, and it should have been investigated further.\n\nRachel Moran, a University of St. Thomas law professor, believes it's unlikely the verdict will be overturned. \"It's an uphill battle to challenge jury deliberations,\" Moran said. \"The standard is very high, and it's difficult to prove that the jury's verdict was the result of error.\"\n\nChauvin's legal team is also arguing for a new trial based on alleged juror misconduct and pressure during deliberations. According to the motion, the defense was not informed about potential misconduct until after the jury had reached its verdict. The court has yet to rule on this issue.\n\nMeanwhile, the prosecution is preparing for the sentencing hearing, which is scheduled for June 25. Prosecutors have introduced \"aggravating factors\" that could increase Chauvin's sentence, including Floyd's use of drugs and the presence of children at the scene of the crime. The defense is expected to present mitigating factors, such as Chauvin's record as a police officer and his remorse for Floyd's death.\n\nIn the meantime, the city of Minneapolis and the wider nation continue to grapple with the aftermath of Floyd's death and the ensuing protests. The trial and its outcome have brought renewed attention to issues of police brutality, racial justice, and criminal justice reform.\n\nRachel Moran, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas, emphasized the importance of maintaining faith in the legal system, regardless of the outcome of Chauvin's new trial motion. \"The legal process is designed to be thorough and fair, and it's important that we trust that process, even when the results may be difficult to accept,\" Moran said.\n\nIn conclusion, Derek Chauvin's legal team has filed a motion for a new trial, alleging several errors during the high-profile trial, including jury and prosecutorial misconduct, and a verdict contrary to law.

I am deeply humbled by the trust the people of New York have placed in me.\"\n\nCuomo, who delivered a farewell address earlier in the day, dismissed the allegations against him as a \"political firecracker\" and defended his record. \"I want you to know that during every challenge, I put the people of this state first,\" he said.\n\nWith Hochul's swearing-in, a majority of New York's most powerful state government positions are now held by women. Assemblymember Yuh-Line Niou commented on the significance, stating, \"This is a groundbreaking moment for New York and for women across the country. Governor Hochul's leadership will pave the way for future generations.\"\n\nHowever, Hochul inherits numerous challenges, including the ongoing COVID-19 resurgence, economic instability, and the housing crisis. Top Aide to Former Governor Cuomo, Melissa DeRosa, recognized these issues, stating, \"Governor Hochul will face numerous challenges, but she has the skills and determination to lead New York through these trying times.\"\n\nHochul and Cuomo differ on COVID-19 measures, with Hochul favoring mandatory masks for schoolchildren. She aims to change the governance culture from Cuomo's forceful approach and has already outlined plans to appoint new aides while reviewing current staff.\n\nCuomo faces legal issues, including allegations of gropping and misleading the public on nursing home deaths. State Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs acknowledged these challenges, saying, \"Governor Hochul will need to address these issues head-on and restore trust in state government.\"\n\nDespite these challenges, Hochul remains optimistic, stating, \"New Yorkers are resilient, and together, we will build a stronger, more equitable New York for all.\""}

Her husband added, \"We're just taking it one day at a time.\"\n\nHarris, the first woman and the first woman of color to hold the office of vice president in the United States, is facing a unique challenge as she settles into her new role. The reason behind the prolonged renovation period at the 9,000-plus square feet mansion built in 1893 is unclear, leading to frustration for the new vice president.\n\nSabrina Singh, Harris' deputy press secretary, said in a statement, \"The Vice President and Second Gentleman are grateful for the hospitality of Blair House during this time, but they look forward to moving into their permanent residence soon.\"\n\nHistorically, new vice presidents have often delayed moving into the official residence to allow for maintenance and upgrades. Elizabeth Haenle, former Vice President Residence Manager and Social Secretary for Former Vice President Dick Cheney, noted, \"It's not uncommon for renovations to take some time. The residence is a historical building, and there are always updates and improvements to be made.\"\n\nWhile Blair House offers luxury accommodations, it does not provide the casual, informal atmosphere Harris and Emhoff prefer. The vice president's residence, on the other hand, offers more privacy, fewer staff, and less formality compared to the White House.\n\nPrevious vice presidents have personalized the residence with unique features such as a heated pool and a horseshoe pit. Harris, who values fitness and cooking, looks forward to utilizing the residence's outdoor space and potentially personalizing it.\n\nHowever, according to Singh, no work is currently being conducted on the kitchen. \"The Vice President has not requested any renovations to the kitchen at this time,\" she clarified.\n\nRenovations and upkeep of the vice president's residence come with substantial government contracts for various works. The exact cost and scope of the current renovations have not been disclosed to the public.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris and Emhoff continue to make the most of their temporary accommodations at Blair House while they wait for their permanent residence to be ready."}

The Queen and her cousin, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, were the only members of the royal family in attendance. The ceremony, which typically sees large gatherings of the royal family on the balcony, was scaled down due to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle, who recently welcomed their second child, a baby girl named Lilibet, were not present at the ceremony. The couple, who stepped down from their senior roles in the royal family in early 2020, have been living in California since then. Kate Middleton and Prince William, who are parents to three children, also missed the event. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are currently on a family holiday in the Isles of Scilly.\n\nTrooping the Colour, also known as The Queen's Birthday Parade, is a grand military procession held in central London, dating back to 17th century. However, due to the ongoing pandemic, consultations with Government and other relevant parties led to the decision to alter the event's traditional format. The Queen, who turned 95 last month, inspected the troops from a balcony at Windsor Castle instead of the usual Buckingham Palace balcony appearance with other members of the royal family.

Former President Donald Trump's lawsuit against Facebook, Google, and Twitter, as well as state-level legislative efforts, underscore the growing Republican concern.\n\nGeoffrey Kabaservice, Vice President of Political Studies at the Niskanen Center, commented, \"There's a perception that these tech companies are biased against conservatives, and it's becoming a major issue for the Republican Party.\"\n\nTrump's lawsuit, filed in Florida federal court, alleges that the tech giants violated his First Amendment rights by suspending his accounts. The lawsuit argues that the companies' actions amounted to public forums, subjecting them to First Amendment protections.\n\nSenator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee) expressed her support for Trump's legal action. \"The time has come for Big Tech to be held accountable for their censorship,\" she stated.\n\nAcross the states, Republican legislators are proposing bills to restrict how social media platforms can regulate speech. Kara Frederick, a Research Fellow at the Center for Technology Policy at The Heritage Foundation, explained, \"These bills aim to prevent tech companies from silencing voices they don't agree with.\"\n\nA recent example of such legislation was a Florida bill that sought to penalize social media companies for removing politicians' speech. However, a federal judge blocked the bill, stating that it conflicted with federal law.\n\nDespite this setback, Texas is considering a bill that would allow residents banned from major platforms to sue those companies. Samantha Fillmore, State Government Relations Manager at The Heartland Institute, expressed her support for the proposed legislation. \"Texas residents should have the right to seek justice when their constitutional rights are violated.\"\n\nLegal experts and some judges argue that social media companies, being private entities, are not subject to First Amendment constraints. However, this perspective is met with skepticism from conservatives.\n\nTrump's attorneys argue that Section 230's protections, which shield tech companies from liability for user-generated content, allow these companies to censor speech without accountability.\n\nResearch and reports from Pew Research Center indicate mixed evidence on whether social media platforms disproportionately silence conservative voices. A 2021 study found that Twitter and Facebook removed more content from Democratic accounts than Republican ones.\n\nHowever, some argue that social media actually amplifies conservative viewpoints. A study by the Media Research Center found that Facebook's trending topics favored conservative content during the 2016 elections.\n\nGeoffrey Kabaservice noted, \"It's important to remember that social media platforms are businesses, not impartial arbiters of information.\" He added, \"They have a financial incentive to engage users, regardless of political leanings.\"\n\nSocial media platforms justify banning Trump and others to prevent further violence and misinformation. Twitter's statement following Trump's suspension read, \"After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.\"\n\nHowever, critics argue that these bans set a dangerous precedent for censorship. Senator Blackburn warned, \"If these tech companies are allowed to decide who gets a voice and who doesn't, our democracy is in trouble.\"\n\nMarsha Blackburn introduced the \"Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act,\" which aims to limit the power of tech companies to censor content. The bill has garnered bipartisan support in the Senate.\n\nKara Frederick believes that this legislation is a step in the right direction. \"We need to ensure that tech companies are held accountable for their actions and don't have unfettered power to silence voices.\"\n\nHowever, some argue that such legislation could infringe upon the free speech rights of tech companies. Legal experts warn that any attempt to regulate these companies must be carefully crafted to avoid unintended consequences.\n\nDespite these challenges, the issue of perceived bias against conservatives in the tech sector is likely to remain a contentious issue in the lead-up to the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nIn response, tech companies have pledged to be more transparent about their content moderation policies. Twitter, for example, has announced that it will provide more detailed explanations for content removals.\n\nHowever, some argue that transparency alone is not enough. Samantha Fillmore believes that \"tech companies need to be held accountable for their actions, not just be more transparent about them.\"\n\nAs the debate continues, it is clear that the issue of perceived bias against conservatives in the tech sector is a complex one with significant implications for our democracy.\n\nGeoffrey Kabaservice warned, \"We need to have an open and honest conversation about the role of tech companies in our democracy and how we can ensure that all voices are heard.\""}

His parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, have been charged with involuntary manslaughter for allegedly giving their son access to a gun and failing to intervene despite concerning signs.\n\nLemond also announced several new safety measures, including increased law enforcement presence in all schools, hiring a security firm for additional guards, and prohibiting backpacks in the schools. \"We understand that these changes may cause some inconvenience, but we believe they are necessary to ensure the safety of our students,\" she said.\n\nCriticism has been aimed at school officials for not taking preemptive action, despite signs of potential danger. Oxford Village Councilwoman and Parent Lori Bourgeau expressed her concerns at a board meeting. \"How could this have been prevented?\" she asked. \"There were warning signs. Why weren't they addressed?\"\n\nShane Gibson, another parent, shared similar sentiments. \"I'm angry and heartbroken that this happened in our community,\" he said. \"But I'm also frustrated that the school district didn't do more to keep our kids safe.\"\n\nThe community and students are experiencing trauma and fear for their safety in the aftermath of the shooting. \"It's been a difficult time for everyone,\" Lemond acknowledged. \"We are providing counseling services for students and staff, and we encourage anyone who needs support to reach out to us.\"\n\nCourt proceedings for Ethan Crumbley and his parents have been delayed to give the Michigan community time to heal and prepare. Oxford High School has been closed since the incident, and other schools in the district have also temporarily closed due to online threats.\n\nLemond urged parents to talk to their children about the importance of reporting any threats or concerning behavior. \"We all have a role to play in keeping our schools safe,\" she said. \"If you see something, say something.\"\n\nThe Oxford Community Schools Board of Education released a statement expressing their condolences to the families of the victims and their commitment to ensuring student safety. \"We are working closely with law enforcement and community partners to implement new safety measures and improve our response protocols,\" the statement read.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Education is also conducting a review of the district's safety protocols and response to the shooting. \"We will take all necessary steps to ensure that our schools are safe and secure environments for learning,\" Lemond concluded.\n\nThe Oxford community remains on edge, with many parents keeping their children home from school due to safety concerns. The shooting has brought renewed attention to the issue of school safety and the importance of addressing warning signs and potential threats before they escalate.\n\nAs the investigation into the shooting continues, the Oxford community is left to grapple with the aftermath of this tragic event and work together to find ways to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.\n\n\"We will get through this, but it will take time and effort from all of us,\" Lemond said. \"We are committed to making our schools a safe and welcoming place for our students to learn and grow.\""}

Vaccines represent an essential tool in the arsenal against SARS-CoV-2, as they train the immune system to recognize and fight the virus without causing the disease.\n\nOnce administered, COVID-19 vaccines function by stimulating an immune response that recognizes and neutralizes the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This response triggers the production of antibodies, which are proteins that help the body combat the virus. These antibodies remain in the body, providing protection against future infection or, at the very least, reducing the severity of symptoms if the individual is exposed to the virus.\n\nIndividuals who have previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2 should still consider getting vaccinated, as doing so can boost their immune response and provide longer-lasting protection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO encourage these individuals to consult with their healthcare providers to determine their eligibility for vaccination.\n\nFollowing vaccination, recipients are advised to stay at the vaccination site for 15 to 30 minutes for observation. This precautionary measure allows healthcare professionals to monitor individuals for any possible reactions to the vaccine, ensuring their safety and well-being.\n\nAlthough COVID-19 vaccines can have mild-to-moderate side effects, these reactions typically resolve within a few days. Common side effects include pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site, as well as fever, fatigue, and body aches. These symptoms are a normal part of the immune response and indicate that the body is building protection against the virus.\n\nSome COVID-19 vaccines, such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, require two doses for maximum efficacy. The recommended interval between doses is 21 to 28 days, with the possibility of extending this interval based on further evidence. WHO advises using vaccines from the same manufacturer for both doses, but flexibility may be considered in specific circumstances.\n\nClinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants have shown COVID-19 vaccines to be safe and effective at preventing severe disease and hospitalization. These trials have demonstrated that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, making vaccines a crucial component in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe longevity of protection provided by COVID-19 vaccines and the potential for vaccinated individuals to transmit the virus are still under investigation. While current evidence suggests that vaccines significantly reduce the risk of transmission, further research is needed to fully understand the role of vaccination in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nDespite the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, it is essential to continue following recommended measures to reduce the spread of the virus. These measures include wearing masks, practicing social distancing, avoiding large gatherings, and washing hands frequently. By adhering to these guidelines, individuals can help protect themselves and those around them from infection.\n\nThe development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines represent a significant achievement in the global fight against the pandemic. However, it is important to remember that the end of the crisis is not yet in sight. Continued efforts are needed to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, address vaccine hesitancy, and encourage the adoption of proven preventative measures.\n\nAs the world moves towards a post-pandemic future, vaccines will play a crucial role in restoring normalcy and preserving the health and well-being of communities around the globe. WHO remains committed to supporting countries in their efforts to secure and administer vaccines, as well as advocating for equitable access to these vital resources.\n\nThe rapid development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines represent a testament to the power of science, collaboration, and resilience in the face of adversity. This achievement serves as a reminder of the importance of investing in research and development, particularly in the context of public health emergencies.\n\nAs we continue to navigate the complexities of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO remains dedicated to providing accurate and timely information on vaccine developments, efficacy, and safety. By staying informed and working together, we can help ensure that the world emerges from this crisis stronger and more prepared for the challenges that lie ahead."}

In 2019, they spread false rumors about a boat carrying Jeffrey Epstein's body after the convicted sex offender's death.\n\nDespite QAnon's baseless claims, there is no evidence to support their theories about the Ever Given or Hillary Clinton. The ship's grounding in the Suez Canal is an unfortunate accident that has caused significant economic consequences.\n\nQAnon's spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories has raised concerns among experts and law enforcement agencies. The group's activities have been linked to increased political polarization, violence, and threats against public figures.\n\nAs the world waits for the Ever Given to be refloated and the Suez Canal to reopen, QAnon followers continue to spread their baseless theories about the ship and Hillary Clinton.

Little did we know that this incident would set off a chain reaction of events that would lead to a very public scandal involving allegations of infidelity.\n\nAccording to reports, Woods' then-wife, Elin Nordegren, was at the scene of the accident and was said to have broken the car's windows to rescue him. The incident sparked widespread speculation of an argument between the couple, adding fuel to the fire of the developing story.\n\nThe aftermath of the scandal was devastating for Woods. He lost most of his sponsors, and his golf career faced significant difficulties. \"Tiger's world came crashing down,\" a source close to Woods told PEOPLE at the time. \"He's lost everything – his family, his friends, and his reputation.\"\n\nIn August 2010, Nordegren filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. She was reportedly granted a settlement of over $100 million. Woods described the period following the scandal as painful and embarrassing in his 2013 memoir, \"A Father's Love.\"\n\nDespite the setbacks, Woods managed to rebuild his life and career. In 2019, he made history by winning the Masters Tournament, his first major championship since the scandal. \"Winning the Masters meant a lot to me,\" Woods said in a press conference after the tournament. \"To now be able to come back and win the tournament is something I'll never forget.\"\n\nWoods recently underwent a successful back surgery, a microdiscectomy procedure. \"The surgery went well, and I'm feeling better each day,\" Woods said in a statement. \"I'm focusing on my recovery and getting back to the things I love.\"\n\nFriends and sources close to Woods highlight his transformation into a better person and father post-scandal. \"Tiger has really turned his life around,\" a source told PEOPLE. \"He's focused on being a great dad to his kids and making amends for past mistakes.\"\n\nNordegren, who has remained largely out of the public eye since the divorce, has also moved on. In an interview with CBS This Morning in 2016, she spoke about her children, Charlie, 11, and Sam, 13, and her role as a mother. \"I am a very protective parent,\" Nordegren said. \"I want them to have as normal a life as possible.\"\n\nThe scandal and its aftermath are explored in HBO's new two-part documentary 'Tiger,' which premiered in April 2022. The documentary features interviews with Woods, Nordegren, and other key figures in the story.\n\n\"Tiger's infidelity was a shock to the world,\" Nordegren said in the documentary. \"But I've moved on, and I'm focused on my children and their happiness.\"\n\nWoods' relationship with his children is described as very close, with effective co-parenting from both Woods and Nordegren. \"Tiger is a great dad,\" a source told PEOPLE. \"He's always there for his kids, and they love spending time with him.\"\n\nThe documentary also explores the fallout from the scandal and the impact it had on Woods' career. \"Tiger's downfall was a cautionary tale for many,\" a sports analyst said in the documentary. \"But he's shown that even in the face of adversity, you can come back stronger than ever.\"\n\nDespite the challenges he's faced, Woods remains an inspiration to many. \"Tiger's story is one of resilience and redemption,\" a fan told PEOPLE. \"He's shown that no matter what life throws at you, you can always bounce back.\"\n\nThe documentary also delves into the cultural significance of Woods' scandal and its impact on race relations in America. \"Tiger's scandal was a turning point in the conversation about race in America,\" a cultural analyst said in the documentary. \"It opened up a dialogue that was long overdue.\"\n\nLooking back on the past decade, it's clear that Woods' scandal was a pivotal moment in his life and career. But through hard work and determination, he's managed to rebuild his life and find success both on and off the golf course.\n\nAs Woods continues to focus on his recovery and his role as a father, it's clear that he's come a long way since that fateful night in 2009. \"Tiger's story is one of hope and redemption,\" a friend told PEOPLE. \"He's proven that no matter what challenges life throws at you, you can always come back stronger than ever.\""}

Six months later, Liya and her family now call Phoenix, Arizona, home.\n\nLiya was just 16 days old when she was handed over to the Marines on August 16, 2021, amid the Taliban's takeover of the city. Her father, Hameed, a linguist and cultural adviser for the U.S. military, arranged for her to be passed through the airport's perimeter wall as the situation grew increasingly volatile.\n\nIn an interview with PEOPLE, Hameed shared, \"When I saw the Marines coming, I knew they could help us. I wanted them to take my daughter because I knew she would be safer with them.\"\n\nHameed briefly held Liya before handing her to another Marine to help his wife, who had been robbed by the Taliban. \"She was so tiny,\" Hameed recalled. \"But she was a fighter, even then.\"\n\nThe image of Liya being lifted over the barbed wire went viral on social media, symbolizing the chaos and turmoil of the U.S. exit from Afghanistan.\n\nPentagon spokesperson John Kirby confirmed in August that Liya was safely returned to her father and treated for an illness at a Norwegian hospital at the airport. \"We're just glad that we could help facilitate the safe transfer of this child and her family to the United States,\" Kirby told reporters.\n\nHameed spoke fondly of his daughter, now six months old. \"She's a fighter,\" he said. \"I'm thinking of adding 'Marine' as her middle name.\"\n\nHowever, an unexpected twist in the story emerged when Lance Cpl. Hunter Clark claimed at a Trump rally that he was the Marine who lifted Liya over the wall. \"I carried that baby over the wall,\" Clark told the crowd, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe Marine Corps quickly denied Clark's claim, stating that it was an \"isolated incident,\" and that Clark was not present at the airport during the event.\n\nClark's actions have since come under investigation for potentially violating Pentagon policies by speaking at a partisan event. Clark's mother, however, told local media that her son could not comment on the matter due to the ongoing investigation.\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE, the Marine Corps said, \"The Marine in question is currently under investigation for potential policy violations. It is important to remember that members of the military are prohibited from engaging in partisan political activities while in uniform.\"\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding Liya's rescue, her family remains grateful for the support they have received from the U.S. military and the American people. \"We are so thankful to be here,\" Hameed said. \"We are starting a new life.\"\n\nHameed also expressed his gratitude for the Marines who helped his family. \"They saved our lives,\" he said. \"They saved Liya's life.\"\n\nLiya's arrival in the United States marked the beginning of a new chapter for her family. They were welcomed with open arms by their new community in Phoenix and have since settled into their new home.\n\nDespite the challenges they have faced, Hameed remains optimistic about their future. \"We are looking forward to starting a new life here,\" he said. \"We are grateful for the opportunity to build a better future for our daughter.\"\n\nThe story of Liya and her family serves as a reminder of the resilience and determination of the human spirit in the face of adversity.\n\nAs Liya grows up, she will undoubtedly be reminded of the incredible journey that brought her to the United States.

The arrest came just a day after the deadly shooting at Oxford High School, located several miles away, where four students were killed.\n\nSouthfield Police Chief Elvin Barren shared the details of the incident in a press conference, stating, \"We received a call from the principal of Southfield Regional Academic Campus reporting a student with a weapon.

Chief Barren noted, \"The student had likely been carrying the weapon for several weeks.\"\n\nWhen asked about the possible motive behind bringing the gun to school, Chief Barren stated, \"The student claimed he found the weapon and had no rounds loaded in the gun's chamber.\" However, authorities are still examining the gun to determine if it has been used in any crimes and the prosecutor's office will decide on charging the teen.\n\nChief Barren emphasized, \"I want to commend the student who reported the gun to the principal for his courageous action.

The gun expertise team on the set included Hannah Gutierrez Reed and Seth Kenney, both from Arizona.\n\nHannah Gutierrez Reed, 24, served as the armorer on the \"Rust\" set, responsible for the care and use of firearms on the production. In an interview with The Santa Fe New Mexican, Gutierrez Reed's lawyers suggested the possibility of \"sabotage\" regarding the live bullet that was discharged.\n\nSeth Kenney, 49, of Tucson, was working as an 'armorer mentor' for Gutierrez Reed on the \"Rust\" set. His company, PDQ Arm & Prop, supplied the guns used on the set, including the Colt .45 revolver Baldwin used.

Around 200 demonstrators gathered in downtown Portland Saturday night, leading to clashes with law enforcement and the declaration of a riot by the Portland Police Bureau.\n\nPortland Police Bureau spokesperson Sergeant Kevin Allen stated, \"Around 200 individuals gathered in the area of SW 3rd Avenue and SW Broadway at approximately 8:00 p.m. Several windows were broken, objects were thrown at officers, and individuals were talking about burning down a government building.\"\n\nTanya Watkins, executive director of Southsiders Organized for Unity and Liberation in Chicago, shared her disappointment and rage over the verdict: \"This verdict is a slap in the face to every Black and Brown person who has ever lost their life at the hands of a white supremacist vigilante. It sends a clear message that the lives of people of color do not matter.\"\n\nSeveral citations were issued in Portland, and one person was arrested on an outstanding warrant. The unrest followed similar protests in cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\nIn Chicago, around 1,000 people marched in a protest organized by Black Lives Matter Chicago and other groups. Watkins added, \"It's important for us to stand together and demand justice, not just for Rittenhouse's victims, but for all the victims of systemic racism and police violence.\"\n\nDozens protested in North Carolina near the state Capitol, accompanied by police officers on motorcycles. Portland Police Bureau Chief Chuck Lovell stated, \"Our officers were prepared for the protests following the Rittenhouse verdict. We expected a large crowd, and we have a plan in place to ensure public safety.\"\n\nHowever, tensions boiled over as some demonstrators in Portland threw urine, water bottles, and batteries at deputies. Lovell commented, \"Unfortunately, a small group of individuals chose to engage in violent and destructive behavior, leading to the declaration of a riot.\"\n\nThe Portland Police Bureau declared the riot at approximately 10:30 p.m. and used tear gas and flashbangs to disperse the crowd. The unrest continued into the early hours of Sunday morning, with reports of vandalism and looting throughout the city.\n\nThe protests over Rittenhouse's acquittal serve as a stark reminder of the deep-seated divisions and tensions that continue to plague the United States, particularly when it comes to issues of race, justice, and police brutality.\n\nAs communities across the country grapple with these complex issues, it's clear that the fight for justice and equality is far from over. Watkins reiterated, \"We cannot allow this verdict to be a setback in our pursuit of a more just and equitable society.

The duo, consisting of singer-songwriter Gregg Alexander and percussionist Danielle Brisebois, took the world by storm in the late '90s with their optimistic message and infectious beats.\n\nThe band's debut album, \"Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too,\" was released in 1998 and quickly gained popularity, reaching the top 10 on the Billboard 200 chart. The record's success can be attributed to its unique blend of pop, rock, and electronic elements, combined with relatable and often satirical lyrics.\n\n\"You Get What You Give,\" the album's lead single, became an anthem for optimism and perseverance. The upbeat and catchy tune resonated with audiences and critics alike, earning the band a Grammy Award nomination for Best New Artist in 1999. But the song held a deeper significance for the Biden family.\n\nPresident Biden's late son, Beau Biden, reportedly used \"You Get What You Give\" as a psych-up song during his chemotherapy treatments. The powerful connection between the Biden family and the New Radicals' music underscores the song's enduring impact and ability to inspire hope during challenging times.\n\nDespite the success of \"Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too,\" New Radicals disbanded before releasing their second single. Alexander, feeling overwhelmed by the spotlight, decided to step away from the music industry.

The unfounded rumor gained traction amidst a broader wave of fabricated stories about high-profile figures, often linked to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nFor the record, Bill Clinton was not in Guantanamo Bay; instead, he had been hospitalized in California for a non-COVID-related infection. Angel Ureña, a spokesperson for the former president, confirmed Clinton's health was improving, and he was in excellent spirits. Ureña stated, \"President Clinton was admitted to Southern California Hospital for the treatment of a non-COVID-related infection. He is on the mend, in good spirits, and is looking forward to getting back to work.\"\n\nThe false claim originated from Real Raw News, a website known for publishing fake stories and conspiracy theories. While the site boasts a disclaimer stating its content contains humor, parody, and satire, this disclaimer is hidden on the about page. Michael Ruffin, who uses the pseudonym Michael Baxter on the site, defends the accuracy of his stories, despite the satire disclaimer.\n\nReal Raw News falsely reported Clinton's death, attributing the information to an unnamed source at Guantanamo Bay and fictitious involvement of a U.S. Naval Hospital officer. Dawn Grimes, the spokeswoman for the U.S. Naval Hospital in Guantanamo Bay, refuted these claims, stating, \"There is no truth to the rumor that former President Bill Clinton died at the hospital. President Clinton was never a patient here.\"\n\nGrimes continued, \"There has been no autopsy performed or overseen by Capt. Dale Ramirez or any other member of our staff regarding former President Clinton. We are focused on the health and well-being of the service members and their families who are under our care.\"\n\nRumors of high-profile figures' deaths or ill health are not new, but the recent surge in such stories can be attributed to the QAnon conspiracy theory. The baseless theory claims that a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles is running a global child sex trafficking ring and that various public figures, including politicians and celebrities, are part of this nefarious plot.\n\nThe QAnon conspiracy theory originated in 2017 on the 4chan message board and has since gained a massive following, with adherents posting their beliefs on social media platforms and in real-life gatherings. The theory has been denounced by law enforcement agencies and fact-checking organizations for its lack of evidence and potential to incite violence.\n\nDespite the overwhelming evidence debunking the QAnon conspiracy theory, its followers continue to spread false rumors about various public figures, including former presidents. In the past, they have falsely claimed that President Barack Obama was a secret Muslim, that Hillary Clinton was involved in a child trafficking ring, and that former President George H.W. Bush was a Satanist.\n\nThe false claim about Bill Clinton's death at Guantanamo Bay is just the latest in a long line of fabricated stories about the former president. In 2016, a false rumor circulated that Clinton had Parkinson's disease. In 2017, another false story claimed that Clinton had been hospitalized for a stroke. And in 2018, a false report stated that Clinton had been arrested for sex crimes.\n\nThese false rumors often gain traction on social media platforms, fueled by the anonymity and lack of fact-checking that exists on these sites. The spread of these false stories can have serious consequences, including damaging the reputations of public figures and inciting violence.\n\nIt is essential to fact-check information before sharing it on social media or believing it to be true. Reputable fact-checking organizations, such as PolitiFact and Snopes, can help verify the accuracy of information.\n\nPolitiFact conducted a fact-check on the false claim about Bill Clinton's death at Guantanamo Bay and found it to be \"Pants on Fire,\" meaning it contained no truth whatsoever.\n\nThe proliferation of false rumors about public figures is a growing concern in today's digital age. Social media platforms must take responsibility for fact-checking the information that is shared on their sites and removing false or misleading content.\n\nIndividuals must also take responsibility for fact-checking the information they consume and share. By doing so, we can help prevent the spread of false rumors and misinformation.\n\nThe false claim about Bill Clinton's death at Guantanamo Bay serves as a reminder of the importance of fact-checking and the potential harm that false rumors can cause."}

Some may have tested positive for the virus but had other underlying health conditions or causes of death. Therefore, it is crucial to interpret state-level data with this context in mind.\n\nHalf of the states in the U.S. report data on COVID-19 breakthrough events, but the frequency and detail of reporting vary significantly. Some states, such as California and New York, provide extensive information on the number of breakthrough cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, while others, like Alabama and Mississippi, do not report any data at all.\n\nDespite the variability in reporting, the available data indicates that breakthrough cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among the fully vaccinated are extremely rare. Across all reporting states, the rates of breakthrough cases are below 1%. For instance, California reported 3,353 breakthrough cases out of over 12 million fully vaccinated individuals, representing a rate of 0.027%.\n\nFurthermore, more than 90% of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths occur among unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated individuals. According to the CDC, as of August 2021, unvaccinated individuals were 14 times more likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19 and 17 times more likely to die from the virus than those who were fully vaccinated.\n\nState-level data supports the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths. It also underscores the importance of robust data collection and reporting at the state level to monitor vaccine effectiveness and inform public health policies. As the pandemic continues to evolve, it is essential to remain informed about the latest data and trends to make informed decisions about personal protective measures and vaccination status."}

Woods, an iconic golfer and athlete, had been involved in a single-car accident, leaving the nation on edge as details unfolded.\n\nJim Gray, a sportscaster for Fox News, set the tone for the intense coverage, stating, \"This is a shocking development in the life of Tiger Woods, one of the greatest golfers of all time.\" Gray highlighted Woods' resilience and ability to endure pain, referencing his remarkable comebacks from injuries throughout his career.\n\nOn MSNBC, Cindy Boren, a journalist for The Washington Post, discussed Woods' recent back troubles and his family being his current priority. She shared, \"Woods has been open about his ongoing struggles with back pain, which have forced him to undergo multiple surgeries and limit his tournament appearances.\"\n\nCNN correspondent Kyung Lah reported that Woods was undergoing surgery, based on a statement from the PGA. However, details about the extent of his injuries and the nature of the surgery remained unclear. Anchor Brooke Baldwin added, \"We'll continue to bring you updates as they become available.\"\n\nDon Riddell, a sports anchor for CNN, explained, \"Tiger Woods is more than just a golfer; he's a cultural icon who has transcended the sport.\" Riddell went on to discuss Woods' impact on golf and his influence on generations of athletes.\n\nSports Reporter and Anchor Andy Scholes of CNN expressed shock but not surprise at the crash, referencing Woods' past DUI arrest. He later apologized for how it was presented, stating, \"I didn't mean to trivialize the situation or make light of Tiger Woods' accident.\"\n\nOther cable news channels had been covering the Senate hearing on the Capitol siege before the news of Woods' accident broke. However, as the gravity of the situation became clear, they shifted their focus to provide around-the-clock coverage of the golf legend's ordeal.\n\nCoverage included speculation and personal stories about Woods, with comparisons to golfer Ben Hogan's comeback after an accident. Hogan, who survived a near-fatal crash in 1949, went on to win six major championships after his recovery.\n\nLos Angeles County Fire Department officials clarified that tools other than the jaws of life were used to extract Woods from the car. They emphasized that Woods was conscious and able to speak with first responders at the scene.\n\nThe intensity of the coverage reflected not only Woods' status as a golfer but also his broader impact on sports and popular culture. Gray summed it up, \"Tiger Woods is more than just a golfer; he's a symbol of determination, perseverance, and the human spirit.\"\n\nAs Woods underwent surgery, the golf community rallied around him, with fellow golfers and fans offering their support and well wishes. The PGA Tour issued a statement, \"Our thoughts are with Tiger Woods and his family during this time.\"\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding Woods' condition and future in golf, one thing was clear: the sports world would be watching and waiting for updates on the legendary athlete's recovery. In the words of Riddell, \"Tiger Woods' story is far from over, and we'll be here to bring you the latest developments as they unfold.\""}

Leading the charge is Facebook, which announced on Thursday that it would remove content containing the phrase \"stop the steal,\" a rallying cry of Trump supporters alleging voter fraud in the 2020 elections.\n\n\"We removed these statements because we believe they contribute to, rather than decrease, the risk of ongoing violence,\" Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement. However, posts using the phrase to condemn the movement or discuss it neutrally will still be allowed.\n\nSheryl Sandberg, Facebook's COO, weighed in on the decision, emphasizing that no one is above the company's policies. \"We've taken significant action in recent days regarding content related to the election and the protests in DC,\" she said in a statement. \"President Trump's account will remain suspended until at least the inauguration.\"\n\nTwitter, which permanently banned President Trump's account on January 8 and continues to ban political advertising in the US, has also taken a firm stance against election misinformation and calls to violence. \"We have been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that violates the Twitter Rules,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nReddit, YouTube, Pinterest, and TikTok are among other platforms that have taken actions against Trump or content related to the \"stop the steal\" movement. For instance, Reddit banned the pro-Trump subreddit \"DonaldTrump\" for violating its content policy. YouTube removed a video of Trump's speech at the Capitol rally that preceded the storming, citing a violation of its policy against incitement to violence.\n\nPeloton, the fitness technology company, even announced a ban on the hashtag #stopthesteal on its platform.\n\nParler, a social media platform popular with Trump supporters and known for its hands-off approach to moderation, faced significant backlash. Amazon suspended Parler from its hosting service, and both Apple and Google removed the app from their app stores, citing concerns about the platform's inability to effectively moderate and remove violent content.\n\nTwitter also took action against QAnon-related accounts, removing over 70,000 accounts and increasing enforcement of its policies against incitement of violence and spreading of misleading information.\n\n\"We will continue to take action on significantly violent or otherwise harmful content reported to us,\" Twitter said in a statement. \"We've been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that violates the Twitter Rules.\"\n\nAs the social media landscape continues to evolve in response to the unprecedented events of the past few weeks, these actions serve as a reminder of the power and responsibility that comes with the ability to connect and communicate online."}

The suspension comes after a series of rule violations, with the social media giant justifying its decision based on a policy that addresses speech by global leaders in the public interest.\n\nTrump's account was initially suspended following the Capitol riot and later reinstated. However, two additional tweets by the President led to the permanent ban. In a statement, Twitter cited its policy against the Glorification of Violence as the reason for the suspension.\n\nTwitter's decision to ban Trump was made in the context of recent events and the potential for inciting violence. The President's messages, including his refusal to attend the Inauguration and labeling his supporters as 'American Patriots,' were interpreted by the company as having the potential to encourage violent acts at the upcoming Inauguration and support violent protests.\n\nReports of planned future armed protests, including attacks on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, were noted by Twitter as a factor in its decision. The company's statement emphasized the need to protect the public conversation and prevent the risk of harm.\n\nTwitter's decision involved subjective analysis and interpretation, going beyond automated algorithms. The company's Trust and Safety team made the final call, taking into account the specific context of Trump's tweets and the current political climate.\n\nThe ban on Trump's Twitter account represents a rare transparent insight into social media content moderation decisions. While the company has previously taken action against the President's account for rule violations, this is the first time Twitter has taken such a significant step.\n\nCritics argue that the ban highlights the challenges of balancing public interest with preventing violence. Some see the move as overdue, given the President's history of controversial tweets, while others view it as an infringement on freedom of speech.\n\nTwitter's decision to suspend Trump's account also raised questions about the role of social media platforms in shaping public discourse and influencing political outcomes. The company's actions could set a precedent for other social media companies and governments in regulating online speech.\n\nThe ban on Trump's Twitter account is not the first time the social media giant has taken action against a high-profile user. In the past, Twitter has suspended the accounts of politicians, celebrities, and activists for violating its rules. However, the permanent suspension of a sitting President's account is unprecedented.\n\nTrump's Twitter account had amassed over 88 million followers, making it one of the most influential voices on the platform. The ban effectively silences the President's ability to communicate directly with his supporters, raising concerns about the impact on public discourse and democratic processes.\n\nTwitter's decision to ban Trump's account sparked a wave of reactions from politicians, activists, and the public. Some celebrated the move as a necessary step to prevent further incitement of violence, while others criticized the decision as an infringement on free speech.\n\nAs the political landscape continues to evolve, the role of social media platforms in shaping public discourse and regulating online speech will remain a contentious issue. Twitter's decision to ban Trump's account is a significant moment in the ongoing debate about the balance between public interest, free speech, and the prevention of violence."}

The statement acknowledged the concerns raised by the couple and expressed the royal family's sadness over the situation.\n\nThe Queen's former press secretary, Charles Anson, stated, \"The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan. The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately.\"\n\nMeghan revealed in the interview that she had felt suicidal during her time in the royal family and that concerns had been raised about the color of their son Archie's skin before his birth. These claims have sparked a global conversation about racism and mental health within the royal family.\n\nPenny Junor, a royal author, commented, \"The interview has certainly shaken the monarchy to its core. The allegations of racism are particularly damaging and will require a robust response from the palace.\"\n\nCrisis talks have reportedly been held among senior royals and aides to discuss the fallout from the interview. The palace had no advance warning of the couple's claims before the broadcast.\n\nAlastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former spin doctor, offered his perspective, \"The palace has been caught off guard by the interview and the allegations. They will need to respond swiftly and effectively to minimize the damage.\"\n\nDespite the allegations, The Queen's statement emphasized that Harry, Meghan, and Archie remain \"much-loved\" family members. The royal family's preference for private engagement with the couple is evident in the statement's tone.\n\nPrince Charles and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have yet to comment on the interview.

The incident has left the film industry reeling and sparked a renewed conversation about safety protocols and regulations regarding the use of firearms and stunts on film sets.\n\nThe specifics of the prop gun's operation and whether Baldwin was performing at the time of the discharge remain unclear. What is known, however, is that prop guns, despite using blank cartridges, can still be lethal at close range due to the force of the wadding ejected from the barrel.\n\nLarry Zanoff, a Hollywood weapons expert, emphasized the importance of adhering to industry safety guidelines for blank firearms. \"It's essential to follow established safety procedures when handling prop guns,\" Zanoff stated. \"This tragedy is a grim reminder of the risks involved and the importance of taking every precaution necessary.\"\n\nComparisons have been drawn to the accidental death of Brandon Lee on the set of \"The Crow\" in 1993, which was caused by a supposed blank firing. The industry was rocked by that tragedy, and this incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential hazards that still exist.\n\nFatal accidents on film sets are not unprecedented. In 1982, the deaths of Vic Morrow, Myca Dinh Le, and Renee Shin-Yi Chen during the production of \"Twilight Zone: The Movie\" led to increased safety regulations and a trial for involuntary manslaughter.\n\nAccording to a 2016 Associated Press report, at least 43 deaths and over 150 life-altering injuries have occurred on U.S. film sets since 1990. Notable fatal accidents include those during the production of \"The Dark Knight\" in 2007, \"The Expendables 2\" in 2011, \"Resident Evil: The Final Chapter\" in 2015, and \"Deadpool 2\" in 2017.\n\nZanoff continued, \"Safety should always be the top priority on a film set, and it's crucial that every member of the crew understands their role in maintaining a safe working environment.\"\n\nBaldwin, in a statement, expressed his condolences to the families of Hutchins and Souza, adding, \"There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother, and esteemed colleague of ours. I'm fully cooperating with the police investigation to address how this tragedy occurred and I am in touch with her husband, offering my support to him and his family. My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna.\"\n\nThe production of \"Rust\" has been halted indefinitely following the incident. New Mexico's Occupational Health and Safety Bureau has launched an investigation into the accident.\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) have both issued statements expressing their condolences and calling for a thorough investigation into the incident.\n\nThe incident has sparked widespread discussions about safety protocols and regulations on film sets. Many are calling for stricter guidelines and increased oversight to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.\n\nZanoff stressed the importance of proper handling and maintenance of prop guns, as well as comprehensive training for crew members. \"Everyone on a film set should be aware of the potential risks and know exactly what to do in case of an emergency,\" he stated.\n\nSAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher released a statement, saying, \"The tragic loss of Halyna Hutchins is a stark reminder that safety must always be prioritized on set.

The trial is now scheduled to begin on November 1, with a status hearing set for May 17.\n\nThomas Binger, the assistant district attorney, and Mark Richards, Rittenhouse's lawyer, jointly requested the delay to allow for more preparation time. \"We both believe this case is significant, and we want to ensure a fair trial,\" Binger stated during the hearing.\n\nRittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the shooting on August 25, 2020, faces multiple charges, including reckless homicide and being a minor in possession of a firearm. He has argued that he acted in self-defense.

The trial is expected to draw national attention, with potential implications for gun rights, self-defense laws, and racial justice.\n\nAs the trial approaches, both sides will continue to prepare their cases. In the meantime, the debate over Rittenhouse and his actions on that fateful night in August 2020 is likely to continue, with passionate voices on both sides of the issue.\n\n\"We will be ready for trial on November 1,\" Binger assured the court. \"We believe that justice will be served.\"\n\n\"Kyle is looking forward to his day in court,\" Richards added. \"He remains confident that he acted in self-defense and that he will be acquitted.\"\n\nAs the legal proceedings continue, the eyes of the nation will be on Kenosha as the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse unfolds.

It's about the collective effort of the entire organization.\"\n\nHowever, some argue that Belichick's record without Brady – a 25-18 mark – suggests a significant impact by the star quarterback. Belichick, who has been the Patriots' head coach and general manager since 2000, dismissed this notion. \"Tom has had an incredible career, and I'm proud of the role I played in helping him develop,\" Belichick acknowledged. \"But let's not forget the countless unsung heroes and late-round draft picks who contributed to our championships.\"\n\nSteve Belichick, Bill's son and the team's safeties coach, compared the Patriots' dynasty to Apple's iPhone. \"My father's impact on the Patriots is akin to Steve Jobs and the iPhone,\" Steve Belichick said. \"He built the foundation, and then Tom came in and revolutionized the game.\"\n\nBelichick's influence extended beyond just drafting Brady in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft.

For instance, linebacker Mike Vrabel, a second-round pick in 1997, played a crucial role in the team's dominance during the early 2000s.\n\nBrady supporters argue that the quarterback's irreplaceable role in critical moments and victories for the Patriots cannot be ignored. \"Tom was the face of the franchise, and he delivered when it mattered most,\" Harrison said. \"He led us to victory in numerous clutch situations.\"\n\nDespite acknowledging the contributions of both Brady and Belichick, many experts believe that Belichick deserves more credit as the primary architect of the Patriots' dynasty. \"Belichick is the mastermind behind the Patriots' success,\" Harrison concluded. \"He built the team from the ground up and made the crucial decisions that put us in a position to win championships.\"\n\nThe debate between Brady and Belichick will likely continue long after their playing and coaching careers have ended. But one thing is certain: Both men played essential roles in creating one of the most successful franchises in sports history.\n\nAs the Patriots and Buccaneers faced off on the field, Brady and Belichick showed mutual respect for each other's achievements. \"Tom and I have a great relationship,\" Belichick said. \"We both understand the importance of teamwork and the role each of us played in the Patriots' success.\"\n\nHarrison echoed this sentiment. \"Tom and Bill are two of the greatest to ever do it,\" Harrison said. \"They pushed each other to be better, and together, they created something special that will be remembered for generations to come.\"\n\nIn the end, the debate over who deserves more credit for the Patriots' success may never be settled definitively. But one thing is clear: Both Brady and Belichick are essential pieces of the Patriots' legacy, and their contributions will continue to be celebrated for years to come."}

The coroner's ruling of her death as a homicide marks a chilling chapter in this young couple's story. Meanwhile, in Florida, law enforcement continues their search for Petito's fiancé, Brian Laundrie, in the densely wooded Carlton Reserve.\n\nHaley Toumaian, a popular TikTok influencer, shared her thoughts on the role of social media in the case, stating, \"Social media can be such a powerful tool for good, and I think this is a perfect example of that.\"\n\nAs the Petito case unfolds, the internet has emerged as both a double-edged sword and an indispensable resource. The relentless pursuit of answers and the quest for justice have led countless internet users, including TikTok influencers, to dedicate their platforms to sharing information, theories, and resources.\n\nIsaac West, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University and the author of \"The Serial Effect: True Crime and Contemporary American Culture,\" sheds light on the phenomenon of online engagement in true crime investigations: \"The internet has given us an unprecedented level of access to these stories, and it's natural for people to want to discuss and dissect the details.\"\n\nOnline discussion platforms like Reddit, TikTok, and Websleuths have become central to the Petito case. The hive mind of these communities has sifted through countless leads and theories, often helping to piece together the puzzle in real-time.\n\nToumaian expressed her appreciation for the Websleuths community: \"I've been following Websleuths since the JonBenét Ramsey case back in the '90s, and I can't tell you how many times they've helped solve cases.\"\n\nThe Websleuths community, known for its rigorous adherence to discussion rules, has set strict guidelines to avoid the spread of misinformation and maintain a focus on factual information. Trained forensic artists, experienced investigators, and dedicated individuals collaborate to help bring closure to victims' families.\n\nWest emphasizes the importance of these online communities, stating, \"They provide a space for people to come together, share knowledge, and work towards a common goal. In the case of Gabby Petito, their efforts have been invaluable.\"\n\nThe puzzle of the internet's contribution to the location of Petito's body and the broader investigation remains. As the search for Brian Laundrie continues, the power of the internet as a tool for justice and as a double-edged sword in true crime investigations becomes increasingly evident.\n\nWest muses, \"It's a fascinating time to be studying this phenomenon. The intersection of technology, true crime, and community engagement is constantly evolving.\"\n\nAs the Petito case continues to unfold, it raises questions about the types of crimes that garner media and social media attention. The internet has provided a platform for the dissemination of information, theories, and speculation in real-time, creating a new era of true crime investigations and public discourse.\n\nToumaian sums up the sentiment of many, \"We may not have all the answers yet, but I believe that together, we can help bring justice for Gabby.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the Petito case serves as a poignant reminder of the power of the internet as a tool for good in the pursuit of justice. As the investigation continues, the impact of social media and online communities on true crime investigations will undoubtedly be a topic of ongoing discussion and fascination.\n\nWest reiterates the significance of this moment, \"It's an exciting time to be a part of this conversation, and I think we're only just beginning to scratch the surface of what's possible.\""}

The decision came in response to concerns that Trump's recent tweets were interpreted as supporting rioters and encouraging armed protests, including a proposed attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 17.\n\nTrump, who had amassed 88.7 million followers before the suspension, accused Twitter of coordinating with Democrats and the Radical Left, claiming censorship and referencing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Institutional accounts like @POTUS and @WhiteHouse remain active but with limited capabilities.\n\nThe suspension follows a broader trend where social media platforms, including Facebook, have begun to more strictly enforce policies against Trump. Both Twitter and Facebook had temporarily suspended Trump's accounts on Jan. 6 during the Capitol riot, with Facebook extending its suspension indefinitely. Trump's tweets after the riot, perceived to glorify violence and undermine the transition of power, were direct factors in Twitter's decision to suspend his account.\n\nThe suspension marks a significant shift in how tech companies handle Trump's account and brings attention to the role of social media in political discourse. Trump and his supporters have criticized the move as an attack on free speech and an example of tech companies' alleged bias against conservatives."}

The vaccine, which is administered as a two-dose series with a lower dose than that for individuals 12 years of age and older, has been shown to be 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19 in this age group.\n\n\"The FDA's authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for emergency use in children 5 through 11 years of age marks a significant milestone in our fight against this global pandemic,\" said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. \"As a mother and a doctor, I know that parents, guardians, and caregivers want tools that will help protect children and help get them back to their normal routines, and we are hopeful that this authorization will provide some of that reassurance.\"\n\nIn clinical trials involving approximately 3,100 children age 5 through 11, the vaccine was found to be well-tolerated with no serious side effects detected. The most common side effects included pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site, as well as fever, fatigue, and headache.\n\n\"The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has undergone the same rigorous evaluation and transparency as all vaccines authorized for emergency use by the FDA,\" said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. \"Today's action follows a thorough evaluation of the clinical trial data, which demonstrates the vaccine's safety and efficacy in this younger population.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will meet next week to discuss further recommendations for the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in children age 5 through 11. The CDC will also issue updated guidance on vaccine administration and dosing for this age group.\n\nCOVID-19 cases in children 5 through 11 make up 39% of cases in those younger than 18 in the U.S., according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. The authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for this age group is expected to help reduce the number of COVID-19 cases among children, as well as help prevent the spread of the virus to more vulnerable populations.\n\nIn addition to the authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children age 5 through 11, the FDA has also authorized a new vaccine formulation using Tris buffer to improve stability and storage conditions. The new formulation will allow the vaccine to be stored at standard refrigerated temperatures for up to 10 weeks, making it easier for healthcare providers to administer the vaccine.\n\nPfizer Inc. has updated its safety monitoring plan to include evaluations of myocarditis and pericarditis, as well as other safety measures. The FDA and CDC have systems in place for continual safety monitoring of the COVID-19 vaccine, including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD).\n\n\"The authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for emergency use in children 5 through 11 is an important step forward in the fight against this pandemic,\" said Dr. Woodcock. \"We will continue to work closely with Pfizer, the CDC, and other partners to ensure that all Americans have access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.\"\n\n\"The FDA's authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for emergency use in children 5 through 11 is based on a thorough evaluation of the clinical trial data, which demonstrates the vaccine's safety and efficacy in this younger population,\" added Dr. Marks."}

The decision came after Trump's repeated calls for his supporters to gather in Washington, D.C., leading to deaths and destruction.\n\nThe storming of the Capitol building on January 6 was the culmination of weeks of escalating tension and false claims about the validity of the 2020 presidential election results made by Trump and his allies. The violent events at the Capitol left five people dead and over 80 injured.\n\nCritics had long urged Twitter to take a firmer stance against Trump for his use of the platform to spread falsehoods and incendiary rhetoric. While Twitter had allowed controversial content from world leaders like Trump, viewing it as newsworthy, the company stated that such accounts are not entirely above its rules.\n\nBefore the permanent suspension, Twitter temporarily suspended Trump's account on January 7 for 12 hours, warning of a permanent ban for policy violations. This came after Trump's tweets following the Capitol violence, which Twitter deemed to be in violation of its Glorification of Violence policy.\n\nHundreds of Twitter employees had urged CEO Jack Dorsey to permanently suspend Trump's account, expressing their concerns over the potential for further harm and the impact on the platform's reputation. Dorsey eventually made the decision to permanently ban Trump, stating that the risk of further incitement was too great.\n\nFacebook also took action against Trump, blocking his account until at least President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20, 2021. Instagram, owned by Facebook, followed suit with a similar suspension.\n\nTrump's permanent suspension from Twitter marked a significant moment in the history of social media and the role it plays in shaping public discourse. Critics of Trump's behavior on social media argued that the actions against him were overdue.\n\nTrump's tweets following the Capitol violence included statements that directly addressed his supporters and urged them to \"remain peaceful,\" but also contained language that could be interpreted as condoning the violence that had occurred. These tweets ultimately led to his permanent suspension.\n\nTwitter's Glorification of Violence policy prohibits content that \"glorifies, praises, or condones violence that has been performed or threatened against individuals or groups, or that we believe may inspire others to replicate violent acts.\" The policy applies to all users, regardless of their status or following.\n\nTrump's suspension from Twitter came as a relief to many, especially those who had been subjected to his divisive rhetoric and false information for years. However, it also raised concerns about the potential for further polarization and the impact on free speech.\n\nThe decision to suspend Trump's account also brought renewed attention to the role of social media platforms in shaping public discourse and the responsibilities they have to their users. Many argued that Twitter and other social media companies must do more to address the spread of misinformation and hate speech.\n\nTrump responded to his suspension by issuing a statement through the @POTUS account, which was later deleted by Twitter for violating its policy against incitement to violence. In the statement, Trump claimed that his account was being taken away \"unfairly\" and that he would not be going away. He also urged his supporters to \"remain peaceful.\"\n\nThe fallout from Trump's suspension from Twitter and other social media platforms is likely to continue for some time. The incident has highlighted the importance of social media in shaping public discourse and the need for these platforms to address the spread of misinformation and hate speech in a responsible and effective manner."}

Darwich accused the pipeline operator of negligence and sought compensation for lost sales due to the widespread fuel shortages caused by a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in late May.\n\nThe ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline led to significant fuel shortages along the East Coast. Thousands of gas stations were forced to shut down or limit operations due to the lack of supply. The ripple effects of the attack reached beyond the fuel industry, disrupting businesses and daily life in many communities.\n\nSeveral class-action lawsuits have emerged against Colonial Pipeline and Scripps Health, a healthcare system in San Diego, California, for damages stemming from the ransomware attacks. Plaintiffs argue that the companies failed to protect their systems adequately, resulting in financial losses and inconvenience.\n\n\"The level of cybersecurity measures in many companies is simply insufficient,\" said John Yanchunis, a veteran class-action lawyer at Morgan & Morgan. \"These attacks can cause significant harm, not just in terms of data theft but also in disrupting essential services like fuel supply and hospital operations.\"\n\nHistorically, companies have faced lawsuits for cybersecurity lapses, such as Target and Home Depot, resulting in settlements worth millions. However, the legal and public perception of damages from cyber breaches has evolved. Courts are increasingly recognizing the tangible harm they can cause.\n\nRansomware attacks lock users out of their systems and demand payment, making them a growing threat to businesses and organizations. In the case of Colonial Pipeline, the attackers demanded a ransom of $4.4 million in exchange for the decryption key to restore access to the company's systems.\n\nIn a statement, Colonial Pipeline acknowledged the attack and the resulting fuel shortages. \"Colonial took immediate action to contain the threat, which has temporarily disrupted pipeline operations,\" the company said. \"The safety and security of our operations remains our top priority.\"\n\nDaniel Solove, a professor at George Washington University Law School and the founder of TeachPrivacy, weighed in on the legal implications of the rising number of ransomware attacks. \"Companies have a duty to protect their customers' data and maintain the services they rely on,\" Solove said. \"When they fail to do so, they can be held liable for the damages.\"\n\nThe settlements in cybersecurity cases are often substantial. In 2019, Equifax agreed to pay up to $700 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over a data breach that affected over 143 million people. In 2015, Target agreed to pay $18.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over a data breach that affected 40 million customers.\n\nAs the number of ransomware attacks continues to rise, discussions on legislative solutions and challenges in achieving fail-proof security systems have intensified. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have issued multiple warnings about the threat and advised organizations to take steps to protect themselves.\n\n\"The best defense against ransomware attacks is a robust cybersecurity program,\" Yanchunis said. \"Companies need to invest in the latest security technologies, train their employees, and conduct regular vulnerability assessments.\"\n\nDarwich, the EZ Mart fuel station owner, expressed frustration over the impact of the fuel shortages on his business. \"We've lost thousands of dollars in sales, and there's no end in sight,\" Darwich said. \"Colonial Pipeline should have done more to protect their systems and prevent this from happening.\"\n\nThe litigation against Colonial Pipeline and Scripps Health is still in its early stages. The outcomes of these cases could set important legal precedents and send a strong message to companies about the importance of cybersecurity. \"It's time for companies to take cybersecurity seriously and invest in the necessary protections,\" Yanchunis said. \"The consequences of failing to do so can be significant and far-reaching.\""}

These assaults, often executed by Russia-linked and other foreign cybercriminal groups, caused widespread disruption and financial losses. John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, emphasized the gravity of the situation, stating, \"These attacks represent a serious threat to essential services and our way of life.\"\n\nOne of the most high-profile attacks occurred in May when the Colonial Pipeline, a major fuel pipeline on the East Coast of the United States, was shut down following a ransomware assault by the DarkSide gang. The attack led to widespread fuel shortages and long lines at gas stations. In response, Colonial Pipelines paid a ransom of 75 bitcoins (over $4 million) to the attackers. However, law enforcement later recovered part of the funds, highlighting the ongoing challenge of dealing with these cybercriminals.\n\nAnother significant attack targeted Kaseya's VSA (Virtual System Administrator) tool, which was compromised by the REvil ransomware gang. Around 1,500 organizations worldwide were affected by the attack, underscoring the vast reach and impact of these cyber assaults.\n\nIn October, Twitch, the popular live streaming platform, experienced a major breach, resulting in the leak of 128 GB of data, including source codes and streamer revenue information. The breach served as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities of even large and well-established companies.\n\nThe Hafnium group, a suspected Chinese state-sponsored hacking group, exploited Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities, affecting tens of thousands of entities globally. The attack, revealed in early 2021, underscored the need for organizations to prioritize and invest in cybersecurity.\n\nNSO Group, an Israeli cybersecurity firm, faced lawsuits from WhatsApp and Apple over its Pegasus spyware, which was allegedly used by autocratic governments for targeted surveillance. The revelations underscored the complex and morally ambiguous world of cybersecurity, where the line between protection and invasion can be blurry.\n\nThe events of 2021 served as a wake-up call for governments, organizations, and individuals, highlighting the continued and increasing threats of cyberattacks. As John Scott-Railton stated, \"It's clear that more comprehensive action is needed to protect against these threats and mitigate their impact. We can no longer afford to be complacent in the face of cybercrime.\"\n\nJBS SA, the world's largest meat processing company, was hit by a ransomware attack in May 2021, affecting its North American and Australian IT systems. The attack forced the company to halt production at several facilities, causing significant disruptions to the global meat supply chain.\n\nAccellion, a California-based software company, faced criticism for its slow patching of vulnerabilities, which led to data breaches and extortion attempts impacting multiple organizations. The incident underscored the importance of timely software updates and effective vulnerability management.\n\nThe events of 2021 served as a reminder that cybersecurity is an ever-evolving challenge, requiring constant vigilance and investment. As the digital landscape continues to expand and evolve, it is essential that governments, organizations, and individuals remain committed to staying one step ahead of cybercriminals."}

I am an Afghan civilian, a humble resident of Kabul, and a survivor of the ongoing crisis in my country.\n\nYesterday, President Biden addressed the world about the ongoing efforts to evacuate American citizens, our Afghan allies, and vulnerable Afghans from Afghanistan. His words brought a glimmer of hope to my heart as I listened, clinging to every detail.\n\nPresident Biden spoke of significant progress since his last address. He mentioned the secured airport, which has allowed flights to resume, and the almost 6,000 brave soldiers on the ground working tirelessly to save lives. I couldn't help but feel a renewed sense of optimism.\n\nThis airlift, described as one of the largest and most difficult in history, has already seen over 18,000 people evacuated since July, with around 13,000 since the military airlift began on August 14.

I am proud to be a part of this incredible achievement.\n\nFlights in Kabul were briefly paused to process arriving evacuees, but they have since resumed. The U.S. is facilitating flights for Allies and partners and working in operational coordination with NATO. The world is coming together to help us in our time of need.\n\nHowever, President Biden emphasized that the evacuation mission is dangerous and cannot guarantee a final outcome without loss. My heart aches for those who have been lost along the way. The uncertainty of the situation is a constant reminder of the precariousness of our situation.\n\nDespite the risks, the commitment to evacuate American citizens and Afghan allies continues. Operational challenges and coordination with the Taliban for safe passage to the airport are ongoing obstacles. But the resolve to save lives remains unwavering.\n\nAs I sit here, writing these words, I am filled with gratitude. Gratitude for the brave soldiers risking their lives to save ours. Gratitude for the U.S. government's unwavering commitment to our safety. Gratitude for the international community's support.\n\nBut I am also filled with hope. Hope that this crisis will lead to a better future for my country. Hope that the world will not forget about us once the headlines fade. Hope that we, the Afghan people, will have the opportunity to rebuild our lives and our nation.\n\nThe situation in Afghanistan is complex and chaotic, but the spirit of humanity shines through. I have witnessed acts of kindness and bravery that restore my faith in humanity. We, the Afghan people, are resilient and determined to rebuild our lives and our country.\n\nBut we cannot do it alone. We need the continued support and commitment of the international community. We need the world to remember us, to stand with us, and to help us rebuild.\n\nAs the evacuation efforts continue, I urge the international community to keep the pressure on the Taliban to ensure safe passage for those seeking to leave Afghanistan. We cannot let the fear of the unknown prevent us from doing what is right.\n\nIn closing, I want to express my deepest gratitude to President Biden, the brave soldiers on the ground, and the international community for their unwavering commitment to saving lives in Afghanistan. May we continue to work together to bring peace, stability, and hope to the Afghan people."}

The group, distinct from the Taliban and al-Qaeda, has focused on seizing territory and carrying out attacks against civilians. Fawaz Gerges, a professor at the London School of Economics, stated, \"ISIS-K has been a significant threat in Afghanistan for years. Their recent attacks demonstrate their ability to launch complex and deadly operations.\"\n\nThe Kabul airport bombings underscored the continued terrorism threat in Afghanistan, despite the Taliban takeover in August 2021. Mohammad Naeem, a Taliban spokesman, emphasized, \"The Taliban are committed to preventing terror groups from using Afghanistan as a base. We will do everything in our power to root out ISIS-K and other extremist factions.\"\n\nPresident Biden defended the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, citing the original mission to neutralize al-Qaeda following the 9/11 attacks. He asserted, \"Our mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to be an indefinite commitment. We achieved our objective: we dismantled al-Qaeda's ability to attack us from Afghanistan.\"\n\nDespite the Taliban's assurances, doubts remain regarding their relationship with al-Qaeda and ISIS-K. Abdul Sayed, an Afghanistan analyst, pointed out, \"The Taliban and al-Qaeda share an ideological alignment and personal relationships, making their separation uncertain.\"\n\nAl-Qaeda is considerably weakened but maintains a presence in Afghanistan, with estimates of members ranging from several dozen to 500. Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted, \"Al-Qaeda still poses a threat to the United States and our allies, and we will continue to monitor their activities closely.\"\n\nA recent U.N. report highlighted the close ties between the Taliban and al-Qaeda, stating, \"There are clear indications that the Taliban and al-Qaeda maintain a relationship, which could evolve as the security situation in Afghanistan changes.\"\n\nDespite their weakened state, Nathan Sales, a former senior counterterrorism official, warned, \"Al-Qaeda currently lacks the capability for immediate threats to the U.S., but its resurgence under the Taliban rule remains a possibility.\"\n\nMichael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center, added, \"ISIS-K is seen as resilient within Afghanistan but unlikely to plan far-reaching attacks. However, their presence raises concerns for Afghanistan's neighbors, particularly Pakistan and Iran.\"\n\nThe international community continues to grapple with the implications of the Taliban's takeover and the resurgence of terror groups in Afghanistan. The U.S. and its allies must navigate a complex geopolitical landscape, balancing security concerns with diplomatic engagements and humanitarian aid."}

This was necessary to lower the ship's ground clearance and help refloat it.\n\nThe Suez Canal Authority (SCA) reported that more than 300 ships were waiting to pass through the canal, with estimates on clearing the backlog ranging from three to more than ten days.\n\nThe chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, Osama Rabie, estimated the canal's daily disruption cost at approximately $15 billion.\n\nThe refloating operation used both conventional earthmoving equipment and specialized ships like dredgers and tugboats. Two dredgers, the 10th of Ramadan and the Mashhour, played a significant role in the operation.\n\nAbout 14 tugboats were used in the rescue efforts, benefitting from high tides caused by a full moon. The SCA managed to create a tide about 1.5 meters higher than average to aid in the ship's refloating.\n\nThe Suez Canal is a vital shipping lane, handling about 12% of global maritime trade, including 7% of the world's oil supply.\n\nThe Ever Given was en route from China to Rotterdam when it became wedged sideways in the canal.\n\nThe SCA reported that the Ever Given had been inspected, and no signs of structural damage were detected. However, an investigation into the incident was ongoing.\n\nThe SCA announced that the Ever Given would be towed to Great Bitter Lake, a large artificial lake in the Suez Canal, for further inspections and assessments.\n\nThe Ever Given incident brought attention to the importance of the Suez Canal and its potential vulnerability to disruptions caused by weather and other factors.\n\nThe SCA has reportedly requested compensation from the Ever Given's Japanese owner, Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., for the costs incurred during the salvage operation.\n\nInternational organizations and governments expressed relief at the successful rescue of the Ever Given and the subsequent reopening of the Suez Canal.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi hailed the successful operation as a \"national duty\" and a testament to Egypt's resilience.\n\nThe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) praised the efforts of the SCA and international partners in resolving the crisis.\n\nThe European Commissioner for Transport, Adina Vălean, welcomed the news, stating that the EU was closely following the situation and working with member states to mitigate any potential impacts.\n\nThe United States Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration also expressed gratitude for the successful operation and the reopening of the Suez Canal.\n\nIndustry experts warned that the backlog of ships waiting to pass through the Suez Canal could lead to congestion and delays in other shipping lanes, further impacting global trade.\n\nAbout 130 additional vessels were en route to the Suez Canal, adding to the congestion. The SCA urged these vessels to change their course to avoid further delays.\n\nShipping companies and logistics providers have reportedly been rerouting cargo ships to alternative maritime routes, such as the Cape of Good Hope or the Panama Canal, to bypass the Suez Canal.\n\nThese alternate routes, however, are significantly longer and more expensive than the Suez Canal, potentially leading to increased shipping costs and extended delivery times for goods.\n\nThe Ever Given incident highlights the importance of redundancy and resilience in the global maritime supply chain.\n\nThe successful rescue of the Ever Given and the subsequent reopening of the Suez Canal marks a significant milestone in ensuring the continued flow of global trade.\n\nThe SCA and international partners will continue to monitor the situation closely and address any further challenges that may arise."}

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began processing payments for about 30 million seniors after obtaining data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) in late March.\n\nMost seniors receiving Social Security retirement benefits, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) benefits are eligible for the automatic payments. These beneficiaries generally don't need to take any action to receive their stimulus payment, as the IRS uses the information from their SSA records to issue the payments.\n\nVeterans receiving benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are also included in this group and will receive their stimulus checks soon. Similar to Social Security beneficiaries, most VA recipients do not need to file a tax return or take any action to receive their payment.\n\nPayments are being made in the same way recipients receive their regular Social Security benefits, mostly electronically through direct deposit. For those who don't receive their benefits electronically, checks will be mailed to their last known address.\n\nHowever, some beneficiaries may need to file a 2020 tax return to claim any additional funds for a spouse or dependents. This includes seniors who weren't eligible for the first two rounds of stimulus checks due to their income levels but now qualify thanks to the expanded eligibility under the American Rescue Plan.\n\nEvery eligible American is set to receive a $1,400 base amount, with $2,800 for married couples filing jointly, and an additional $1,400 for each eligible dependent. The third stimulus checks will be phased out for individuals with higher adjusted gross incomes, following the income thresholds established by the American Rescue Plan.\n\nThe deadline for filing a 2020 tax return has been extended to May 17, 2021, giving more time for those who need to file a return to claim any additional stimulus funds they may be entitled to. The IRS encourages seniors and other eligible individuals to use the \"Get My Payment\" tool on IRS.gov to check the status of their stimulus payment and ensure their bank account information is up to date."}

Biden wore a mask, and most attendees, including Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff, also wore masks.\n\nKamala Harris made history as the first female vice president and the first person of Black and South Asian descent to hold the office. She was sworn in by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is the first Latina Supreme Court justice. Harris wore a purple coat, a nod to the suffragette movement.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Biden emphasized unity, democracy, and overcoming challenges together as a nation. He said, \"We have learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.\"\n\nBiden called on Americans to end the \"uncivil war\" that has fractured the country and to come together. He said, \"To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a good hard look. If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America. The right to dissent peaceably within the guardrails of our republic is perhaps our nation's greatest strength.\"\n\nThe ceremony was attended by a small, socially distanced audience, including former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, as well as former vice presidents Dick Cheney and Al Gore. First lady Jill Biden wore a blue coat and matching mask, and President Biden wore a navy blue suit and mask.\n\nVice President Harris broke several barriers with her inauguration. She is the first woman, the first Black person, and the first person of South Asian descent to hold the office. Her election also marked the first time that both the president and the vice president were Catholic.\n\nBiden highlighted the importance of democracy and its resilience in facing tests. He said, \"We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts.\"\n\nWith Biden's inauguration, former President Donald Trump left office after a tumultuous four years. Trump, who did not attend the ceremony, became the first president to be impeached twice and the first to refuse to attend his successor's inauguration. Biden's inauguration marked the peaceful transfer of power, a tradition that has been upheld in the United States since its founding."}

This is a significant achievement in our efforts to control the spread of the virus and protect public health.\n\nAt the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we understand the importance of maintaining the integrity of the authorized dosing schedules for these vaccines. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires a 21-day interval between doses, while the Moderna vaccine requires a 28-day interval. These schedules have been determined based on the clinical trial data that support the vaccines' safety and efficacy.\n\nDiscussions about altering vaccine dosing schedules or mixing vaccines are considered premature without solid evidence. Changing the authorized dosing schedule without adequate data may pose a significant risk to public health. Misinterpretation of data regarding a single dose's effectiveness can lead to unwarranted assumptions about protection.\n\nThere's concern that altering dose regimens without understanding the protection depth and duration could be harmful. The FDA's role includes assuring the safety and effectiveness of drugs, vaccines, and other biological products. We are committed to providing the public with accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nHealthcare providers are strongly recommended to follow the FDA-authorized dosing schedule for COVID-19 vaccines.

Revlon, a cosmetics company, had an outstanding loan with Citigroup, and the $8 million payment was supposed to be an interest installment. However, Citigroup mistakenly transferred nearly $900 million, causing confusion among the creditors.\n\nSome creditors, recognizing the mistake, returned $400 million, but ten others refused to return the $500 million they had received. The dispute escalated into a legal battle, with Citigroup seeking to recover the remaining funds.\n\nJudge Furman ruled in Citigroup's favor, citing legal precedents and the creditors' reasonable belief that the payment was intentional due to its accuracy. \"The law does not require perfection from financial institutions in every transaction,\" Furman stated in his decision. \"New York law aims to discourage banks from making such errors in the first place, but it does not impose an affirmative duty to chase after mistaken overpayments.\"\n\nAdam Abensohn, representing the asset managers at Quinn Emanuel, argued that there is nothing unfair about keeping money that is owed. \"Our clients did not demand this money; it was sent to them in good faith,\" Abensohn stated. \"The funds were transferred accurately, and our clients acted in accordance with their legal and ethical obligations.\"\n\nThe ruling, which may be appealed by Citigroup, has raised questions about the responsibilities of creditors when a bank overpays. Should creditors be obligated to return overpayments, even if they were unaware of the error? Or does the principle of \"first come, first served\" apply, allowing creditors to keep funds that were mistakenly transferred to them?\n\nThe decision has sparked a debate on rules versus principles in financial transactions. \"This is a complex issue with no easy answers,\" said Steven Davidoff Solomon, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law. \"On one hand, the law should encourage banks to make accurate payments. On the other hand, it's important to protect the rights of creditors and prevent windfalls.\"\n\nDealBook is inviting reader opinions on the matter for possible inclusion in a future newsletter. What do you think? Should creditors be obligated to return overpayments, even if they were unaware of the error? Or should they be allowed to keep the funds, especially if they acted in good faith? Please share your thoughts.\n\nMeanwhile, Citigroup and the ten creditors are in negotiations to resolve the matter. The outcome of these discussions could set a precedent for similar cases in the future. Stay tuned for updates on this developing story."}

Some of the guns in the photo are semi-automatic versions of weapons that are restricted to military and law enforcement or specially licensed civilians.\n\n\"It's Christmas time and we're wishing for ammo from Santa,\" Massie wrote in the caption, accompanied by a photo of his family standing in front of a Christmas tree, guns in hand.\n\nThe post drew immediate criticism from Democratic U.S. Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, who chairs the U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee.\n\n\"At a time when our communities are reeling from gun violence, it's incredibly insensitive for Rep. Massie to post this photo,\" Yarmuth told Reuters in a statement. \"Thoughts and prayers are not enough – we need action.\"\n\nEthan Crumbley, 15, was identified as the perpetrator of the school shooting in Oxford, Michigan, which took place on Nov. 30. His parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, were also arrested in connection with the incident.\n\nMassie's campaign manager, Jonathan van Norman, did not respond to comment requests from Reuters.\n\nThe incident highlights tensions over gun control and gun rights debates in the United States, which have been a contentious issue for decades. Massie represents a solidly Republican district in Kentucky, where gun ownership is a deeply ingrained part of the culture.\n\nYarmuth's reaction is not an isolated one, as calls for gun control measures have grown louder in the aftermath of mass shootings and other acts of gun violence in the United States. Some Democrats have proposed measures such as universal background checks and red flag laws, while Republicans have generally opposed such measures.\n\nThe issue is likely to remain a contentious one in the run-up to the 2022 midterm elections, with both parties seeking to galvanize their bases on the issue.\n\nIn the meantime, communities across the country are grappling with the aftermath of gun violence and the emotional toll it takes on families and communities. The Oxford shooting is just the latest in a long line of incidents that have sparked calls for action and soul-searching about the role of firearms in American society.\n\n\"We need to do more than just offer thoughts and prayers,\" Yarmuth said. \"We need to take action to prevent these tragedies from happening in the first place.\""}

This represents a dramatic increase from less than one percent when President Biden took office. Building on this progress, the Administration announced two major vaccination policies designed to further increase vaccination rates, protect workers, prevent hospitalizations, and save lives.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will require employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their workforce is fully vaccinated or undergo weekly COVID-19 testing, with paid time for vaccination. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will mandate that health care workers at Medicare and Medicaid participating facilities be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. These rules cover over 100 million workers in the United States.\n\nThese new policies aim to protect workers, prevent hospitalizations, and save lives. They are based on extensive scientific evidence showing the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. Economists unanimously agree that vaccination requirements will lead to a faster and stronger economic recovery. The rules also preempt any inconsistent state or local laws that limit employers' authority to require vaccinations, masks, or testing.\n\nThe impact of these vaccination mandates has already been demonstrated in participating organizations. Vaccination rates have increased by over 20 percentage points in some cases. The new OSHA and CMS requirements will provide further incentives for millions of Americans to get vaccinated. By increasing vaccination rates, we can strengthen our economy, save lives, and move closer to ending this pandemic once and for all."}

However, cybersecurity experts contend that the ransom is insignificant compared to the potential damage and Colonial Pipeline's financial capabilities. Jonathan Reiber, Head of Cybersecurity Strategy at AttackIQ, remarks, \"Five million dollars is a drop in the bucket for a company like Colonial Pipeline. The real damage is the disruption to their operations and the potential for long-term reputational harm.\"\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline, with significant assets and income, has paid substantial dividends to its owners, including the Koch family. Mark Ostrowski, Head of Engineering at CheckPoint, asserts, \"It's concerning that, despite their financial resources, critical infrastructure like Colonial Pipeline may not have prioritized adequate cybersecurity investments.\" James Reynolds, Chief Product Officer at SecureAge, adds, \"There's a consensus that the affordability of cybersecurity investments for a company like Colonial Pipeline is not an issue.\"\n\nRecent cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, such as the Colonial Pipeline attack and the SolarWinds hack, underscore the vulnerability of these systems and the high societal costs of inadequate preparation. Jennifer Bisceglie, CEO and Founder of Interos, emphasizes, \"These incidents serve as a reminder that cybersecurity threats are not going away, and we need to invest in resilient and secure interconnections in the digital economy.\" Richard Glick, Commissioner at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, stresses, \"Mandatory cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure are essential to protect our national security and economy.\"\n\nThe shift to remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic increases cybersecurity challenges, making \"zero-trust\" architecture essential. Robert Cattanach, Partner at Dorsey & Whitney Law Firm, explains, \"Zero-trust assumes that every connection to the network could potentially be compromised, and requires constant verification of user identity and device security.\" The Biden Administration has taken steps to improve cybersecurity, including an executive order for stricter standards and disclosure.

On August 25, 2020, the then-17-year-old Rittenhouse, carrying a semiautomatic rifle, fired eight shots during a protest over a police shooting, leaving Rosenbaum, 36, and Huber, 26, dead and a third man injured.\n\nDespite the legal outcome, it is crucial to remember that this incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers that accompany the display and use of firearms at public protests. Rittenhouse's decision to bring a rifle to the protest resulted in an unspeakable tragedy, one that we as a society should strive to prevent in the future.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is essential to recognize that the Second Amendment does not necessitate bringing weapons to protest sites. In this particular case, Rittenhouse's possession of a rifle was only dismissed as a legal issue, not a Second Amendment issue, by the trial judge. Therefore, it is important to view this matter from a broader perspective.\n\nAmerica's deep-rooted love for firearms is undeniable. However, the context in which they are displayed and used can have significant consequences. Protests, by their very nature, are emotionally charged events where tempers flare and tensions run high. Introducing firearms into this volatile mix only serves to escalate the situation and increase the likelihood of violence.\n\nThe tragic deaths of Rosenbaum and Huber underscore this point. Both men were unarmed when they were shot by Rittenhouse. The chaos and anger of the protest that night undoubtedly played a role in Rittenhouse's decision to bring a rifle and ultimately use it in self-defense, or so his legal team argues. Yet, had Rittenhouse not brought a weapon to the protest, this tragic outcome may have been avoided.\n\nFurthermore, the mere presence of firearms at protests can create an environment of fear and intimidation. Protesters, who are exercising their constitutional right to peacefully assemble, should not have to fear for their safety due to the actions of those who choose to bring weapons to these events.\n\nIt is disheartening to consider that the Rittenhouse case may not lead to a meaningful dialogue on the dangers of mixing firearms and angry protests. Instead, it may further entrench the belief that the Second Amendment grants an unfettered right to bear arms in any situation, regardless of context.\n\nMoreover, the acquittal of Rittenhouse may embolden others to bring firearms to protests in the future. This is a dangerous precedent, one that threatens the very fabric of our democratic institutions and the principles of peaceful protest.\n\nAs we move forward, it is crucial that we, as a society, reflect on the lessons from the Rittenhouse case and take steps to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future. This may include stricter regulations on the possession and use of firearms at protests or increased education and awareness about the risks associated with bringing weapons to these events.\n\nUltimately, the deaths of Rosenbaum and Huber serve as a poignant reminder of the potential consequences of bringing firearms to protests. As we grapple with the aftermath of this tragic incident, it is incumbent upon us to engage in a thoughtful and nuanced conversation about the role of firearms in our society and the need to ensure the safety and well-being of all Americans, particularly during times of heightened tension and unrest."}

Brooks in Capitol Riot Lawsuit, Impacting Trump's Case\n\nWASHINGTON, July 29 – The U.S. Justice Department's decision to refuse defending Rep. Morris \"Mo\" Brooks (R-AL) in a lawsuit accusing him of inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol attack has significant implications for former President Donald Trump's ongoing legal battles related to the riot.\n\nDonald Ayer, a senior Justice Department official, announced on Thursday that the department would not be representing Brooks in the lawsuit filed by Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA). The lawsuit alleges that Trump and Brooks conspired to incite the Capitol attack to prevent the certification of Joe Biden's election victory.\n\n\"The facts alleged against Rep. Brooks do not involve the performance of his duties while acting within the scope of his office or employment under the Westfall Act,\" Ayer said in a statement.\n\nThis decision sends a clear message that incitement of an attack on Congress is beyond the scope of employment for federal employees, including Members of Congress. The Westfall Act grants federal employees immunity when they are acting within the scope of their employment.\n\nExperts view the Justice Department's decision as a warning sign for Trump, suggesting he may not receive immunity under the Westfall Act for his actions related to the Capitol riot.\n\nJesse Binnall, an attorney for Trump, downplayed the significance of the Justice Department's decision, stating, \"The Westfall Act does not apply to the President of the United States.\" Trump's primary defense does not rely on the Westfall Act but rather on presidential immunity.\n\nAnne Tindall, an attorney with Protect Democracy, a nonprofit organization that advocates for constitutional norms and the rule of law, shared a different perspective. \"This decision shows that the Justice Department is taking a tougher stance against those who incited the Capitol attack,\" she said. \"It's a worrying sign for Trump's case.\"\n\nTrump and Brooks are co-defendants in Swalwell's lawsuit. Trump is also facing two other lawsuits related to his actions on and before Jan. 6. In addition to Swalwell's lawsuit, the District of Columbia and a Capitol Police officer have separately sued Trump for his role in the riot.\n\nBrooks attempted to use the Westfall Act for immunity, but his request was denied. Legal experts believe Trump's case is weaker than Brooks', as Trump had no official role in the election certification process.\n\nSome Democrats have expressed concern over the Justice Department's decision not to defend Brooks, viewing it as an overreach of executive power. However, others argue that the department is protecting the office of the presidency, not Trump personally.\n\n\"It's important to separate the office of the presidency from the individual who holds the office,\" said Tindall. \"By refusing to defend Brooks, the Justice Department is sending a message that no one is above the law, not even the President of the United States.\"\n\nLegal experts agree that the Justice Department's decision may be bad news for Trump. \"It sets a precedent that could make it more difficult for Trump to argue that he is entitled to immunity for his actions on Jan. 6,\" said a senior legal scholar who asked to remain anonymous."}

Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., one of the lawmakers leading the charge for answers, stated, \"The idea that individuals could have given tours or facilitated access to the Capitol to individuals who then engaged in violent insurrection is deeply troubling.\"\n\nMore than 30 members of Congress have signed a letter to the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms and the Capitol Police demanding an investigation into the alleged pre-riot tours and possible collaboration.\n\nRioters seemed to have specific knowledge of the Capitol's layout, as they targeted the offices of high-profile Democrats such as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Financial Services Committee Chair Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.\n\nClaims have also emerged suggesting involvement from Republican House members Andy Biggs, Paul Gosar, and Mo Brooks in planning the Jan. 6 \"Stop the Steal\" rally that preceded the breach. 'Stop the Steal' organizer Ali Alexander made these allegations in tweets and videos since deleted.\n\nIn a statement, Biggs, R-Ariz., dismissed the claims, saying, \"There is absolutely no truth to the rumor or innuendo that I was involved in granting tours to rioters prior to Jan. 6.\" Gosar, R-Ariz., and Brooks, R-Ala., have not commented on the allegations.\n\nU.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who also signed the letter, revealed that he has heard names of lawmakers who allegedly gave tours but is awaiting verification before disclosing them.\n\nSherrill argued that without proper credentials from Congress members, the rioters couldn't have entered the Capitol. However, this theory has been met with skepticism, as many rioters were seen wearing MAGA hats and other pro-Trump paraphernalia, indicating they were not Congress members.\n\nU.S. Rep.

Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., added, \"The fact that there are credible reports that some members of Congress may have facilitated the breach of the Capitol is incredibly disturbing.\"\n\nInvestigations into these allegations have been requested from the House Sergeant at Arms, Senate Sergeant at Arms, and Capitol Police. However, progress on these investigations has been unclear.\n\nDespite the lack of concrete evidence linking the tours to the riot or the targeting of specific offices, calls for accountability and transparency continue to grow.\n\nAlexander, the 'Stop the Steal' organizer, claimed in an interview with The New York Times that he had coordinated with members of Congress to help plan the Jan. 6 rally, though he did not specify which members were involved. Alexander later deleted his social media accounts following the publication of the interview.\n\nAs the investigations continue, both Democrats and Republicans call for a thorough examination of the events leading up to the Capitol breach and for those responsible to be held accountable.\n\nIn the meantime, tensions remain high on Capitol Hill, with some members fearing for their safety and calling for increased security measures.\n\nSherrill stated, \"We cannot allow what happened on Jan. 6 to ever happen again. We need to get to the bottom of this and make sure that the Capitol is secure for all members of Congress and for the American people.\"\n\nRyan added, \"We owe it to the American people to find out exactly what happened and hold those responsible accountable.

The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria-Khorasan (ISIS-K) claimed responsibility for the attack, which marked the worst single-day loss for American troops in Afghanistan since August 2011.\n\nThe fatalities occurred as the US and its allies were rushing to evacuate their citizens and Afghan allies ahead of the Taliban's takeover of the war-torn country.

The cause of the crash was never definitively determined.\n\nAugust 21, 2003, was a tragic day for the US Army's 502nd Infantry Regiment, also known as the \"Infidel Battalion.\" Thirteen soldiers were killed and 27 were wounded when their convoy was ambushed in Ghazni Province.\n\nOctober 29, 2001, saw the deadliest day for US special operations forces in Afghanistan. Eleven members of the US Special Forces were killed in a helicopter crash in the Shah-i-Kot Valley.\n\nSeptember 15, 2001, just weeks after the 9/11 attacks, US forces began their military campaign in Afghanistan. In one of the deadliest engagements, on October 7, 2001, 30 US soldiers were killed in the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi, also known as the Battle of the Forty Martyrs.\n\nThe list of deadliest days for US troops in Afghanistan is a stark reminder of the sacrifices made by the men and women in uniform during the 20-year war.\n\nThe deaths of the 13 American soldiers at Kabul airport on August 26, 2021, not only marked the worst single-day loss for US troops in Afghanistan since 2011 but also served as a poignant reminder of the ongoing risks and challenges faced by the military personnel in the war-torn country.\n\nAs the US and its allies continue their evacuation efforts, the threat from terror groups like ISIS-K remains a significant concern.\n\nThe Taliban, who took control of Afghanistan on August 15, 2021, have pledged to ensure the safety and security of foreign forces and civilians during the evacuation process.\n\nThe US and its allies are racing against time to evacuate as many people as possible before the August 31 deadline set by the Taliban.\n\nThe ISIS-K, an offshoot of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has claimed responsibility for several high-profile attacks in Afghanistan in recent years. The group is known for its deadly suicide bombings and attacks on military and civilian targets.\n\nThe attack on August 26, 2021, at Kabul airport was not the first time ISIS-K has targeted US forces in Afghanistan. In January 2016, the group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed five US service members and two American contractors in Jalalabad."}

This groundbreaking moment marked several firsts: the first woman, the first Black person, and the first Asian American to hold the position. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the trailblazing first woman of color on the Supreme Court, administered the oath.\n\nQuote from Justice Sonia Sotomayor: \"Today, we take another historic step. I am honored to administer the oath of office to Vice President Kamala Harris.\"\n\nDuring the ceremony, Harris used two Bibles for the swearing-in, one belonging to family friend Regina Shelton and the other once owned by the late Justice Thurgood Marshall. The combination of personal and historical significance added depth to this momentous occasion.\n\nFor Harris, the swearing-in was a poignant reminder of her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, and the countless individuals relying on their leadership. In her speeches, Harris often acknowledges her mother's influence, emphasizing the importance of paving the way for future generations.\n\nQuote from Kamala Harris: \"Mom, you're always in my heart and my mind. I won't let you down.\"\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, who officiated at Harris's swearing-in ceremony, addressed the significance of Harris's role for children worldwide. \"This moment shows them that anything and everything is possible,\" she said.\n\nQuote from Sen. Amy Klobuchar: \"This is a day that will inspire young girls and boys all across our country and around the world. Today, we celebrate the progress we've made as a nation.\"\n\nThe vice presidential oath, shared with that taken by members of Congress, focuses on defending the Constitution and faithfully discharging the duties of the office. As Harris took the oath, she pledged to uphold these principles and serve the American people.\n\nBeyond her gender and race, Harris holds another significant first: she is the first graduate of a historically Black college (Howard University) and the first member of a Black sorority (Alpha Kappa Alpha) to become vice president.\n\nHarris's role as vice president represents a significant breakthrough in U.S. politics, shattering both gender and racial barriers. Her election marks a moment of pride for the Black, Asian, and female communities, as well as a testament to the power of perseverance and determination.\n\nThe use of Bibles with personal and historical significance during the swearing-in ceremony served as a reminder of the unique journeys that led Harris and Sotomayor to their current positions. Their stories of resilience and determination symbolize the broader social progress that continues to unfold in the United States.\n\nAs the United States enters a new era with Harris and President Joe Biden at its helm, the significance of this historical moment cannot be overstated. The swearing-in of Kamala Harris as Vice President represents not only a personal triumph but a triumph for all those who have fought for equality, justice, and representation.\n\nQuote from Kamala Harris: \"We are here because of generations of women and men who fought for equality, who fought for justice, who fought for freedom. We stand on their shoulders.\""}

However, this information is inaccurate, according to legal experts.\n\nRoss Garber, an impeachment and political investigations lawyer and Professor at Tulane Law School, clarified, \"Impeachment without removal from office does not affect a former president's post-presidency benefits or their ability to run for office again.\"\n\nStephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, echoed Garber's statement, adding, \"Impeachment alone does not result in the loss of these benefits or the ability to run for office.\"\n\nJosh Blackman, a law professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston, further explained, \"The Former Presidents Act only revokes a president's pension if they are impeached and then removed from office by the Senate.\"\n\nThe tweet's claims about a $1 million travel allowance being revoked are also incorrect. Garber clarified, \"Presidents are not given a $1 million travel allowance. This is a misunderstanding of the benefits provided to former presidents.\"\n\nAs for Secret Service protection, there is some uncertainty. Vladeck stated, \"It is uncertain whether a president removed from office would lose lifetime Secret Service protection, as there are conflicting laws on this matter.\"\n\nTo disqualify Trump from future office, the Senate would need to have a separate vote after a conviction, a process not bypassed by impeachment alone. Vladeck explained, \"The 14th Amendment provides that any person who has engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof shall be disqualified from holding any office, civil or military, under the United States.\"\n\nBlackman added, \"However, it is unclear if the presidency falls under an 'Office of honor, Trust or Profit' that one can be disqualified from holding after impeachment and conviction.\"\n\nGarber noted, \"The travel allowance mentioned in the tweet is for former presidents without lifetime Secret Service protection, which does not apply to Trump as he is entitled to it.\"\n\nThe person who posted the tweet admitted the information might be incorrect and was surprised by its viral success. They stated, \"I didn't realize it would blow up like this. I was just trying to share something I thought was interesting.\"\n\nIn conclusion, a second impeachment of Donald Trump would not prevent him from running for office again or strip him of benefits, including a pension, travel allowance, and Secret Service detail. These benefits can only be revoked if Trump is impeached and removed from office by the Senate. The misconceptions in the viral tweet were clarified by legal experts Ross Garber, Stephen Vladeck, and Josh Blackman."}

This initiative, made possible by the American Rescue Plan, will support the National Health Service Corps, Nurse Corps, and Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery programs.\n\nVice President Harris stated, \"The health and well-being of every American depends on a strong and diverse health care workforce. Today, we're taking a critical step forward in addressing disparities in health care professions and outcomes, and preparing for the projected shortage of up to 60,000 primary care doctors, dentists, and psychiatrists over the next decade.\"\n\nThis investment will directly support over 22,700 health care providers. More than 23.6 million patients across the country receive care from clinicians within these programs, ensuring access to essential services in communities that need it most.\n\nAddressing racial and ethnic disparities in health care professions and outcomes is a key priority of this initiative. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, only 5% of physicians identify as Black or African American, 5% as American Indian or Alaska Native, and 7% as Hispanic or Latino. By increasing representation within the health care workforce, we can improve health outcomes for all communities.\n\nAdditionally, the federal government will award an additional $330 million in funding for primary care education to help meet the growing need for health care professionals. By investing in the next generation of health care providers, we are ensuring a strong workforce to meet the demands of our communities.\n\n\"These investments are in line with the recommendations of the Presidential COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force,\" said Vice President Harris. \"Our administration is committed to centering equity in the COVID-19 response, and this funding is just one part of our broader efforts.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Biden-Harris Administration announced $785 million for equity-focused programs and initiatives as part of this commitment. Together, these investments will support initiatives aimed at addressing health disparities, expanding access to mental health services, and increasing representation within the health care workforce.\n\nVice President Harris continued, \"The American Rescue Plan is making a difference in the lives of millions of Americans, and this investment in our health care workforce is just one example of how we're putting equity at the center of our response to the pandemic and beyond.\""}

According to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Johann Schloegl, Woods told deputies at the scene and later at the hospital that he could not recall how the collision occurred.\n\nDeputy Schloegl submitted an affidavit for a search warrant to obtain the vehicle's black box. \"The data from the black box could provide valuable information regarding the cause of the collision,\" Schloegl stated in the affidavit, obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nLos Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva clarified that the ongoing investigation into the crash is not a criminal investigation. \"There is no criminal suspicion at this time,\" Villanueva said during a press conference. \"Mr. Woods was cooperative, and we don't have any reason not to believe him when he says he doesn't know how it happened.\"\n\nThe absence of a criminal investigation does not preclude the collection of evidence. The search warrant for the vehicle's black box was granted, and investigators were able to recover data from the device.\n\nCar accident reconstruction experts suggested that Woods may have had a \"very delayed response\" to the emergency, indicating he might not have been paying attention at the time of the crash.

The storm, which made landfall on August 29, 2021, as a Category 4 hurricane, brought with it 150-mph winds and extensive storm surge.\n\nRelief captain Shannon Dryden and his team were among the approximately 40 boats with around 300 people that remained at Port Fourchon during the landfall. According to Dryden, they were unable to leave before the hurricane struck.\n\n\"We knew the storm was coming, but we didn't think it was going to be this bad,\" said Dryden. \"We tried to leave, but the conditions were too treacherous.\"\n\nAs the storm approached, visibility issues and destructive winds made it difficult for the crew to secure their vessel and the barges they were towing.\n\n\"It was chaos out there,\" recalled Dryden. \"The winds were howling, and the rain was coming down in sheets. We couldn't see more than a few feet in front of us.\"\n\nOne significant moment of fear for the crew occurred when a loose boat collided with their barge, breaking it free from its moorings. \"That was the scariest part,\" admitted Dryden. \"We thought we were going to lose the barge.\"\n\nBut the crew managed to secure the barge again once the eye of the storm passed. \"We were relieved, but we knew the back side of the hurricane was still coming,\" said Dryden.\n\nChett Chiasson, executive director of the Greater Lafourche Port Commission, reported no major injuries among the crews at Port Fourchon. \"Everyone did an excellent job of preparing and securing their vessels before the storm,\" Chiasson said.\n\n\"The conditions were extremely challenging,\" Chiasson continued. \"But our crews were well-trained and did an excellent job of riding out the storm.\"\n\nAs the back side of the hurricane hit, the crew of the Brittany Lynn faced additional challenges as the winds and waves continued to batter their vessel.\n\n\"We thought we had weathered the worst of it, but the storm still had some surprises in store for us,\" Dryden said.\n\nDespite their successful efforts to secure their vessel, Dryden expressed that he would never choose to ride out a storm on a boat again. \"It was a harrowing experience, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone,\" he said.\n\nPort Fourchon, located in the heart of Louisiana's oil and gas industry, is a critical port for the region.

Shoei Kisen now faces a $916.5m compensation claim from the SCA.\n\nIn hearings at the Ismailia economic court this week, Shoei Kisen appealed against the detention of the Ever Given and contested the SCA's compensation claim. Ahmed Abu Ali, a member of Shoei Kisen's legal team, stated, \"The SCA's actions were not justified, and there was a clear miscommunication between the pilots and the control tower.\"\n\nAccording to Abu Ali, \"The SCA allowed the Ever Given to enter the canal despite poor weather conditions, which was against their own regulations, and failed to provide adequate tugboat support.\"\n\nRecordings obtained by Reuters revealed disagreements among SCA pilots and the control center regarding the ship's entry into the canal. One pilot was heard warning of strong winds, while the control center gave the green light for the Ever Given to proceed.\n\nLawyers for Shoei Kisen argue that the SCA's actions do not qualify as a 'salvage operation' under legal definitions, challenging the basis for the compensation claim. Abu Ali explained, \"A salvage operation is carried out to save a vessel in distress, not to compensate for damages caused by negligence.\"\n\nShoei Kisen is seeking $100,000 in initial compensation for detention-related losses, including the cost of food and accommodation for the crew, as well as fees for alternative transport routes.\n\nThe SCA argues that the Ever Given's grounding caused significant damage to the canal's banks and the ecosystem, justifying the compensation claim. An SCA spokesperson stated, \"The Suez Canal is a vital global waterway, and any disruption to its operations has far-reaching consequences.\"\n\nThe hearings at the Ismailia economic court also addressed the issue of the Ever Given's detention. Shoei Kisen argues that the detention is unjustified, as they have cooperated fully with the investigation into the grounding.\n\nAhmed Abu Ali stated, \"The detention of the Ever Given is a violation of international maritime law, and our client intends to take all necessary legal action to have the vessel released.\"\n\nA court decision on the case is expected on Sunday. Regardless of the outcome, the dispute between Shoei Kisen and the SCA is likely to set a precedent for future incidents in the Suez Canal.\n\nThe grounding of the Ever Given in March not only highlighted the importance of the Suez Canal as a global trade route but also shed light on the complex legal and financial issues that can arise from such incidents.

The US Embassy in Kabul was evacuated earlier this month, and US troops have been securing the airport to facilitate the evacuation process.\n\nThe United States began withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan in April 2021, fulfilling a promise made by President Biden during his campaign. The withdrawal was accelerated in the wake of the Taliban's rapid advance across the country, which began in May 2021.\n\nThe attack on Kabul airport is a grim reminder of the ongoing threats faced by US and allied forces in Afghanistan and the challenges of leaving the country after 20 years of military engagement."}

He has, however, maintained that he never tried to influence CNN's coverage of his brother and never attacked any woman who came forward.\n\nVeteran TV executive Shelley Ross claimed that Chris Cuomo groped her 16 years ago, an allegation he has apologized for. \"I deeply apologize to Shelley Ross for my unprofessional behavior at a party more than 16 years ago,\" Cuomo said in a statement. \"As Shelley acknowledged in her own statement, I couldn't see that I was making her uncomfortable.\"\n\nVictims' rights advocates and alleged victims of Andrew Cuomo's misconduct had called for CNN to fire Chris Cuomo prior to his termination. \"There's no way that Chris Cuomo can continue to work at CNN with any credibility,\" said Sherry Todoroff, a lawyer representing several women who have accused Andrew Cuomo of sexual misconduct.\n\nAndrew Cuomo resigned as New York governor on August 10, following an investigation by the state attorney general's office that found he had sexually harassed multiple women.\n\nThe scandal surrounding the Cuomo brothers comes at a time when CNN is facing increased competition from other news outlets and streaming services. Ratings for the network have been declining in recent months.\n\nCNN's decision to terminate Chris Cuomo was widely praised by media watchdog groups and critics of the network. \"CNN made the right decision in terminating Chris Cuomo,\" said Tucker Carlson, host of Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight. \"The network's credibility was on the line, and they took the necessary steps to protect it.\"\n\nCuomo's departure from CNN marks the end of a storied career in television journalism. He had been with the network since 2013, and before that, he worked at ABC News and Fox News.\n\nIt is unclear what Chris Cuomo's next move will be. He has not made any public statements about his future plans.\n\nThe scandal surrounding the Cuomo brothers is not over yet. The New York attorney general's office is still investigating allegations of sexual misconduct against Andrew Cuomo, and Chris Cuomo's role in his brother's defense could still be the subject of further scrutiny."}

According to Dan Cohan, an Associate Professor of Environmental Engineering at Rice University, \"The extreme cold temperatures in Texas were a perfect storm, causing both conventional and renewable energy sources to fail.\"\n\nThe unusually cold temperatures strained Texas' energy grid, leading to electricity prices spiking over 10,000%. Cohan explained, \"The demand for electricity soared as people sought warmth in their homes, while power generation dropped due to frozen wind turbines and natural gas wells.\"\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the state's power grid, was criticized for its handling of the crisis. ERCOT had warned of potential power outages, but many were caught off guard by the severity and duration of the blackouts.\n\nFossil fuels and renewable energy sources were both affected by the Arctic temperatures. Cohan noted, \"Natural gas wells froze, limiting the supply of fuel for power generation, while wind turbines iced over and solar panels were coated in snow.\"\n\nThe lack of winterized infrastructure in Texas was a significant contributing factor to the crisis. Cohan stated, \"Texas has been criticized for not investing enough in winterizing its energy infrastructure, leaving it vulnerable to extreme cold snaps.\"\n\nThe decision to isolate Texas' energy grid from the rest of the country was also highlighted as a contributing factor to the crisis. Cohan explained, \"Being independent from the rest of the grid means that Texas doesn't have access to backup power when its own grid fails.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a completely unrelated story, Citibank accidentally transferred $900 million to Revlon's lenders, losing a legal bid to recover the funds. According to a statement from Citibank, \"We deeply regret the error and are working to rectify the situation as quickly as possible.\"\n\nIn other news, McDonald's launched new chicken sandwiches with a promotional $5 swag bundle. A spokesperson for McDonald's said, \"We're excited to offer our customers a delicious new chicken sandwich and a great value with our $5 swag bundle.\"\n\nVegan KitKat bars were also introduced, offering a plant-based alternative to traditional KitKats. A representative from Nestle, the manufacturer of KitKat, stated, \"We're thrilled to introduce our new vegan KitKat bars, which will allow more people to enjoy the classic KitKat taste without the use of animal products.\"\n\nIn the world of finance, Bitcoin reached an all-time high above $50,000, benefiting from low-interest rates that weakened the US dollar. Jesse Furman, a US District Court Judge, weighed in on the topic, stating, \"The rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a reflection of the growing distrust in traditional financial institutions and the desire for decentralized, digital currencies.\"\n\nDespite the various news stories, the Texas power crisis continued to dominate headlines as millions remained without power and temperatures remained below freezing.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott called for an investigation into the power outages and criticized ERCOT for its handling of the crisis. Abbott stated, \"The people of Texas deserve answers and action. We will get to the bottom of what caused this power outage and hold those responsible accountable.\"\n\nERCOT blamed the power outages on the extreme cold temperatures and the high demand for electricity. However, some experts pointed to the lack of winterized infrastructure and the decision to isolate Texas' energy grid as significant contributing factors.\n\nCohan emphasized the importance of investing in winterized infrastructure to prevent future power outages. He stated, \"Texas needs to learn from this crisis and invest in the necessary upgrades to its energy infrastructure to ensure that its residents are not left in the cold during future extreme weather events.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some Texans were turning to alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to generate their own electricity. A spokesperson for a local solar panel installation company stated, \"We've seen a surge in demand for solar panels and battery storage systems as people look for ways to generate their own electricity and become more energy independent.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Texans remained resilient and came together to support one another during the crisis. Neighbors checked on each other, shared resources, and offered words of encouragement.\n\nThe Texas power crisis was a stark reminder of the importance of investing in infrastructure and being prepared for extreme weather events. Cohan emphasized, \"We need to take a proactive approach to infrastructure investment and climate adaptation to ensure that we're not caught off guard by future extreme weather events.\""}

The House is expected to vote on impeachment articles this week, with the Senate trial taking place after Trump leaves office on January 20, 2021. This impeachment marks the first time Trump is accused of inciting violence against another branch of government.\n\nThe Constitution mandates impeachment for \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" Democrats allege that Trump, by denying the validity of the 2020 presidential election results and pressuring Georgia's secretary of state to \"find\" votes, incited violence that led to the Capitol riots on January 6, 2021.\n\nThe House can impeach with a simple majority, and fast actions are expected without extended investigations. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) had previously offered alternatives to impeachment, such as the 25th Amendment or censure, but these were not taken up by the Democratic caucus.\n\nThe impeachment articles are being drafted by the House Judiciary Committee and are expected to be introduced this week. The articles will likely focus on Trump's role in inciting the Capitol riots and his efforts to overturn the election results.\n\nIf convicted in the Senate, Trump could be barred from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the U.S. This would include future runs for public office, potentially impacting Trump's plans for a 2024 presidential bid. Additionally, a second impeachment conviction could also impact Trump's pension.\n\nThe Senate trial might be conducted on a half-day basis to allow time for other legislative activities, such as confirming President-elect Joe Biden's cabinet nominees. However, the exact timeline for the trial has not yet been determined.\n\nThe impeachment process began in earnest on January 13, 2021, when Pelosi announced that the House would proceed with impeachment articles. In a letter to her colleagues, Pelosi wrote, \"The President of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our common country. He must be impeached.\"\n\nThe Democratic-controlled House has the votes to impeach Trump for a second time. However, it remains to be seen whether the Senate, which is currently controlled by the Republicans, will convict Trump. A two-thirds vote is required for conviction in the Senate.\n\nThe impeachment trial comes as the country is still reeling from the Capitol riots, which left five people dead and dozens injured. The riots disrupted the certification of Biden's election victory, delaying the formal transfer of power from Trump to Biden.\n\nTrump's first impeachment trial took place in the Senate in early 2020. He was charged with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in connection with his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Trump was ultimately acquitted by the Senate in February 2020.\n\nThe current impeachment trial is expected to focus on Trump's role in the Capitol riots and his efforts to overturn the election results. However, it remains to be seen how the Senate will handle the trial, given the political divisions in the country and within the Republican Party.\n\nThe impeachment trial is also taking place against the backdrop of Biden's inauguration on January 20, 2021. Biden is expected to be sworn in as the 46th President of the United States, marking the end of Trump's presidency and the beginning of a new chapter in American history.\n\nThe impeachment trial is likely to dominate the political headlines in the coming weeks, as the country grapples with the aftermath of the Capitol riots and the transition of power from Trump to Biden. It remains to be seen how this historic second impeachment trial will unfold and what the ultimate outcome will be.\n\nIn conclusion, President Donald Trump is facing a historic second impeachment trial in the U.S. House of Representatives. The trial is expected to focus on Trump's role in inciting violence against the U.S. government and his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. The trial comes as the country is still reeling from the Capitol riots and as Biden prepares to be sworn in as the 46th President of the United States. The outcome of the trial remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: this is a pivotal moment in American history."}

The sheriff's office will work with the coroner's office to verify the identity of the remains.\n\nSatterlee was last seen checking storm damage outside his home on Aug. 29, the day after Hurricane Ida caused devastating flooding in the region.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Satterlee family during this difficult time,\" Vitter said in a statement. \"We appreciate the community's patience and support throughout this investigation.\"\n\nThe attack occurred near Satterlee's home, where wildlife agents spotted the alligator using a drone. Louisiana Department of Wildlife licensed nuisance hunters were called in to capture the reptile.\n\nSatterlee's wife, Linda, was present during the attack and witnessed her husband being dragged into the water by the alligator. She lost one of his arms during the encounter.\n\n\"I tried to get help, but when I returned to the scene, Mr. Satterlee was gone,\" Linda Satterlee said in a statement released by the sheriff's office. \"I've lived in this community for over 50 years, and Tim was a beloved pillar.

The stay in proceedings is aimed at grouping similar claims together to reduce legal costs and court time.\n\nStewart Buckingham, a court lawyer representing some of the claimants, stated, \"The key issue here is that we've got potentially 1,000 or more claims that are going to be brought against this ship. So, it's in everyone's interest to try and manage that as efficiently as possible.\"\n\nThe Ever Given and Evergreen Group, the Taiwanese shipping company that operates the vessel, are the involved parties in this case. An earlier court order limited some claims against the ship to 84 million pounds ($116 million).\n\nStewart Buckingham further commented, \"The idea is that the court will review all of those claims over a two-month period, and then at the end of that, it will give directions as to how those claims are going to be dealt with, which might involve alternative dispute resolution methods like arbitration.\"\n\nThe Ever Given grounded in the Suez Canal on March 23, 2021, causing a six-day standstill that stranded hundreds of ships and affected international trade worth billions of dollars.\n\nThe ship's owners, Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., claim they are not liable for the grounding incident. There were some damages to the ship, but no injuries, deaths, or pollution were reported from the incident.\n\nJudge Baker stated during the hearing, \"The primary issue that the court will have to determine is whether or not the grounding was due to the act or omission of the master or the crew of the Ever Given, or was it due to some external cause.\"\n\nThe resolution of any claims filed in the U.K. might take years and could involve arbitration. The court will assess the filed claims during a further hearing scheduled in two months."}

The storm's devastating power was exacerbated by the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, which fueled its rapid intensification.\n\nAndrew Dessler, a professor at Texas A&M University's College of Geosciences, emphasizes the connection between climate change and stronger, more destructive hurricanes. \"Climate change is not just something that's going to happen in the future. Its impacts are being felt now,\" Dessler said.\n\nThe United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently released a report stating that human influence has unequivocally warmed the planet, leading to an increase in weather and climate extremes. This warming trend contributes to higher storm surges, more rainfall, and stronger winds, making hurricanes like Ida more destructive.\n\n\"The climate system is responding to our actions, and we're starting to see the consequences in the form of extreme weather events,\" Dessler explained. \"Hurricane Ida is just one example of this.\"\n\nRecent hurricanes, including Ida, have demonstrated the potential for rapid intensification, making timely evacuations and disaster responses more challenging. According to Dessler, \"The window of opportunity to prepare for these storms is shrinking. We need to be more proactive in mitigating the impacts of climate change.\"\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Ida left Louisiana struggling with widespread power outages and infrastructure damage, delaying residents' return to their homes. Dessler warned against unpreparedness for climate change effects, noting the vulnerability exposed by a winter storm in Texas earlier this year.\n\n\"The winter storm in Texas showed us that extreme weather events can happen at any time, not just during hurricane season,\" Dessler said. \"We need to be better prepared for these events and invest in infrastructure that can withstand the impacts of climate change.\"\n\nDespite these challenges, Dessler remains hopeful that political action and awareness can help mitigate the worst effects of climate change for future generations. \"We have the technology and resources to make a difference,\" he said. \"But we need the political will to implement the necessary changes.\"\n\nAs the world continues to face the consequences of climate change, it is essential to recognize the urgency of the situation and take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the changing climate. Hurricane Ida serves as a reminder that the impacts of climate change are not just theoretical – they are happening now, and we must be prepared to face them head-on.\n\n\"Climate change is not a problem for future generations,\" Dessler emphasized. \"It's a problem for us, and we need to act now to ensure a better future for ourselves and for those who will come after us.\""}

Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies confirmed that an investigation into the incident is ongoing, and the possibility of criminal charges and civil lawsuits looms large.\n\nMary Carmack-Altwies, the Santa Fe District Attorney, stated, \"We're looking at every aspect of this: criminal, civil, regulatory, and worker's compensation. Safety is a crucial component in every film production, and it appears that something went terribly wrong here.\"\n\nThe decision to finish or abandon \"Rust\" carries significant implications for those involved. Finishing the film could result in legal and financial outcomes, while abandoning it would mean writing off the considerable investment already made.\n\nMichael Davis, counsel at DTO Law, explained, \"If the production company decides to finish the film, they may be able to recover some of their costs through insurance. However, if they abandon the project, they could face substantial financial losses.\"\n\nInsurance may provide some coverage for costs related to the shutdown and legal defenses, but there's a limit to the coverage. According to Andrew Hurwitz, co-chair of the entertainment group at Frankfurt Kurnit, \"Film production insurance typically covers third-party claims for bodily injury or property damage, but it doesn't cover criminal investigations or regulatory fines.\"\n\nBefore the tragic incident, \"Rust\" reportedly had difficulty obtaining a completion bond, which is crucial for financial security in film production. A completion bond guarantees that a film will be completed and delivered to the distributor.\n\nHurwitz added, \"The absence of a completion bond complicates financial recovery and legal defense strategies for the production. It also puts the distributor in a difficult position, as they may have to bear the financial burden of completing the film or face potential lawsuits from investors.\"\n\nBankruptcy is being considered as a potential path forward for the production to manage lawsuits and financial liabilities. However, it could further complicate matters, as creditors might seek to recover assets related to the film.\n\nThe tragedy has prompted reconsideration of the use of guns on film sets and the necessity of completion guarantees. Davis commented, \"This incident underscores the importance of having robust safety protocols and financial security measures in place. Producers must take these matters seriously to protect their investors, cast, and crew.\"\n\nCompletion bond premiums and insurance costs may rise, impacting larger studios less than independent filmmakers. Hurwitz noted, \"Insurance companies will want to mitigate their risk, so they may increase premiums for productions with a history of safety issues or financial instability.\"\n\nThis incident could lead to systemic changes in film production practices, especially around safety and financial security. Carmack-Altwies emphasized, \"We need to learn from this tragedy and ensure that productions prioritize safety and financial responsibility to prevent such incidents from happening again.\"\n\nAs the industry grapples with the aftermath of the \"Rust\" tragedy, it remains to be seen what steps will be taken to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. One thing is clear: the film industry must reevaluate its approach to safety, financial security, and risk management in the wake of this devastating event."}

The bill, which could result in a $100,000 daily fine for de-platforming politicians, is seen as a response to the banning of former President Donald Trump from major platforms.\n\nDeSantis, a Republican, accused social media companies of stifling free speech, even if it incite violence. \"Social media companies should not be able to silence voices just because they disagree with them,\" DeSantis said during a press conference. \"This proposal will ensure that Floridians' voices are heard and that social media companies cannot suppress content based on political viewpoints.\"\n\nDavid Schoen, a lawyer for Trump, argued that the former president's speech before the Capitol riot was protected under the First Amendment. \"The First Amendment protects Mr. Trump's right to express his opinions, even if some find them objectionable,\" Schoen said.\n\nBruce Castor, another lawyer for Trump, disputed claims that the former president incited violence. \"There is no evidence that Mr. Trump's words incited the riot at the Capitol,\" Castor said.\n\nThe bill would require social media companies to give a 30-day notice before suspending accounts and to explain the reasons for suspensions. DeSantis criticized social media companies for what he perceives as bias against conservatives, citing the lack of action against Black Lives Matter and Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nBlaise Ingoglia, R-Spring Hill, Chair of the Florida House Commerce Committee, expressed support for the proposal. \"Social media companies have too much power, and it's time for us to hold them accountable,\" Ingoglia said.\n\nHowever, Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, a Democrat, suggested the focus should be on reducing Big Tech's monopoly power at the federal level. \"Florida attempting to regulate private companies is a distraction from the real issue,\" Fried said.\n\nSenate President Wilton Simpson, R-Trilby, acknowledged that Florida has limited power to intervene with Big Tech. \"Congressional action is necessary to address the monopolistic practices of social media companies,\" Simpson said.\n\nDeSantis argued that the Hunter Biden story suppression proves social media bias and criticized platforms for not moderating threats against him. \"Social media companies cannot pick and choose which voices to suppress,\" DeSantis said.\n\nDeSantis avoided directly answering whether he believes the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, instead comparing the situation to claims of Russian interference in the 2016 election. \"The issue is not about the election, it's about protecting free speech and holding social media companies accountable for their actions,\" DeSantis said."}

Fauci, M.D., Director of the NIAID, emphasized the importance of preparing for potential booster shots due to waning immunity and the ongoing evolution of the virus. \"As we continue to monitor the real-world effectiveness of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines, it's crucial that we also investigate the safety and efficacy of various booster combinations,\" said Dr. Fauci. \"This trial is an essential step toward understanding the optimal vaccine regimens for the evolving pandemic.\"\n\nThe clinical trial, named \"A Randomized Phase 1/2 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of Mixed Schedule COVID-19 Vaccines,\" is being conducted at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, and the University of Maryland, College Park. Robert L. Atmar, M.D., Principal Investigator at Baylor College of Medicine, and Kirsten E. Lyke, M.D., Principal Investigator at the University of Maryland, College Park, will lead the study.\n\nInitially, 150 participants who have received one of the three Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorized (EUA) COVID-19 vaccines – Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson – will receive a booster dose of the Moderna vaccine. Participants will be followed for a year post-vaccination for safety monitoring, side effects, and immune response evaluations.\n\nThe trial includes separate cohorts for individuals initially unvaccinated, who will then receive the two-dose Moderna vaccine regimen. An adaptive design of the trial may introduce new arms as additional vaccines receive EUA or variant vaccines become available. This flexibility allows the study to address the rapidly changing COVID-19 vaccine landscape.\n\n\"This clinical trial represents an essential contribution to the global understanding of COVID-19 vaccines,\" said Dr. Atmar. \"As we work to protect people from this virus, it's crucial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of various vaccine combinations and schedules.\"\n\nDr. Lyke echoed Dr. Atmar's sentiments: \"The ability to adapt the study design as new vaccines and variants emerge ensures that we can provide valuable data to inform public health policy on using mixed vaccine schedules if booster doses become necessary.\"\n\nInitial results from the trial are expected in late summer 2021, and trial information can be found on clinicaltrials.gov under identifier NCT04889209. The NIH is the primary federal agency for medical research in the U.S., focusing on infectious, immune-mediated diseases, and other illnesses."}

In an interview, Krebs described the order as a \"dramatic game changer\" that has the potential to significantly improve security for both government and consumer software products.\n\nThe executive order, signed on May 12, 2021, directs the Commerce Department to create new standards for software vendors supplying the federal government. According to Krebs, these new standards will increase software security expectations and have a cascading effect on products sold to American customers.\n\n\"This executive order is a big deal,\" said Krebs. \"It sets the bar high for software security expectations not just for the federal government, but also for the private sector.\"\n\nKrebs emphasized the need for both presidential and congressional action to fortify the nation's cyber infrastructure. He pointed out that while the executive order is a significant step forward, more needs to be done to address the growing cybersecurity threats.\n\nDuring the interview, Krebs also touched upon the profitability of ransomware and the recent high-profile attack on Colonial Pipeline. The attack involved the payment of a ransom to the cybercriminal gang DarkSide, which is believed to be primarily composed of Russians.\n\n\"Ransomware is a lucrative business for cybercriminals,\" said Krebs. \"The Colonial Pipeline attack is just one example of how these groups can cause significant disruption and demand large ransoms.\"\n\nKrebs also commented on the possible link between ransomware groups and Russian intelligence. According to him, there is growing evidence that some of these groups have ties to state-sponsored actors.\n\n\"There is a growing body of evidence that some ransomware groups have ties to Russian intelligence,\" said Krebs. \"It's important that we continue to investigate these links and take action against these groups to protect our critical infrastructure.\"\n\nThe cybersecurity expert also discussed the SolarWinds hack, stressing the lessons learned from it and the need for businesses to enhance their cybersecurity practices.\n\n\"The SolarWinds hack was a wake-up call for the business community,\" said Krebs. \"It showed that even the most sophisticated organizations can be targeted by advanced threat actors. It's important that businesses take a proactive approach to cybersecurity and invest in the right tools and resources to protect their networks.\"\n\nKrebs was fired by former President Trump in November 2020 after debunking Trump's false election fraud claims.

The discrepancies between the statement and video evidence have once again raised concerns about inaccurate initial police reports in fatal encounters.\n\nAndre Johnson, a professor of Communication Studies at the University of Memphis, commented on the issue, stating, \"Inaccurate initial police reports in cases of police use of force, especially fatal encounters, are not uncommon. Unfortunately, it can take significant time for the truth to come out, leading to public mistrust.\"\n\nCriminal justice experts assert that inaccurate initial police reports are a common issue, often shaped by the need to protect officers and departments. However, video evidence from bystanders has been critical in revealing the truth in several cases, such as Eric Garner's and Walter Scott's deaths.\n\nWith about 80% of large police departments now using body cameras, the issue of inaccurate initial reports has gained new attention. Storage costs are high, and footage release can be delayed, but recent trends show police and prosecutors releasing body camera footage more swiftly to address public outcry and demands for transparency.\n\nMinneapolis police spokesperson John Elder admitted the initial statement on Floyd's death was inaccurate but explained that they were unable to correct it immediately due to the ongoing investigation. He stated, \"We understand the concerns about the initial statement, and we are committed to providing accurate and complete information as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe quick release of body camera footage in recent cases, such as the fatal shooting of 16-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant in Columbus, Ohio, and the shooting of Anthony J. Thompson Jr. in Knoxville, Tennessee, has helped address discrepancies between initial reports and video evidence.\n\nColumbus Police Chief Elaine Bryant explained their decision to release the footage quickly, stating, \"Transparency is crucial in building trust between law enforcement and the communities we serve.\" In Knoxville, District Attorney Charme Allen released the body camera footage after public pressure, contradicting initial statements that Thompson had been armed and posed a threat.\n\nDespite these efforts, concerns about inaccurate initial police reports persist, highlighting the need for ongoing training, accountability, and transparency in law enforcement."}

Buck, who led \"Cuomo Prime Time\" to the number one spot at CNN, is now working on CNN+.\n\nBuck's departure comes as another former executive producer, Shelley Ross, accused Cuomo of gropping her at a party in 2005. Ross made her allegations public in an op-ed published in The New York Times last week.\n\nCuomo acknowledged the interaction with Ross but emphasized it was not sexual in nature and that he had apologized at the time. However, Ross criticized Cuomo's response to her op-ed as lacking enlightenment and understanding.\n\nIn her op-ed, Ross detailed how Cuomo apologized via email after the alleged incident. She compared his actions to those of actor Christian Slater, who was accused of groping a woman in 1997.\n\nRoss stated that Cuomo's apology seemed intended to provide him with legal and moral coverage rather than genuine remorse. She did not call for Cuomo to be fired but urged him to \"journalistically repent\" for his actions.\n\nThe incident and Cuomo's apology resurfaced amid scrutiny of Cuomo's handling of his brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's, sexual harassment scandal. Chris Cuomo has not publicly addressed Ross's allegations on his CNN show.\n\nMelanie Buck joined CNN in 2013 and was promoted to executive producer of \"Cuomo Prime Time\" in 2018. She is known for her role in shaping the show's coverage and bringing in high-profile interviews.\n\nBuck's transfer to CNN+ is believed to be a mutual decision between her and the network. A CNN spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.\n\nShelley Ross was the executive producer of ABC's \"Good Morning America\" when she met Chris Cuomo at a party in 2005. She alleges that Cuomo reached under her shirt and grabbed her breast during the encounter.\n\nCuomo responded to Ross's op-ed with a statement acknowledging the incident but denying that it was sexual in nature. He said, \"I acknowledge that I did touch her at the party that night. I apologized to her then and I meant it.\"\n\nRoss's op-ed sparked a wave of reaction on social media, with some calling for Cuomo to be fired and others defending him. The incident has cast a shadow over CNN's primetime lineup, which also includes the controversial Tucker Carlson.\n\nCuomo's handling of his brother's sexual harassment scandal has also come under scrutiny. Chris Cuomo was seen advising his brother on how to respond to the allegations during on-air segments and in private conversations.\n\nAndrew Cuomo resigned as New York Governor on August 10, 2021, following an investigation into multiple sexual harassment allegations. Chris Cuomo has not been implicated in the scandal.\n\nThe incident with Shelley Ross is not the first time Chris Cuomo has been accused of inappropriate behavior. In 2014, he was accused of making inappropriate comments to a former colleague at ABC.\n\nCuomo's apology to Ross came in the form of an email, which she shared in her op-ed. In the email, Cuomo wrote, \"I'm genuinely sorry. Call me when you have a moment to talk. I have learned a lot since that night.\"\n\nRoss wrote that she was \"surprised and disappointed\" by Cuomo's response. She felt that his apology was insincere and that he had not taken responsibility for his actions.\n\nCuomo's handling of the Ross allegation has been compared to the way he handled his brother's scandal. Some critics have accused him of using his platform to defend himself rather than addressing the allegations directly.\n\nCNN has faced criticism for its handling of the Chris Cuomo situation. Some have called for the network to take action against the anchor, while others have defended his right to due process.\n\nThe incident with Shelley Ross is not the only allegation of inappropriate behavior against Chris Cuomo. In 2020, a former producer accused him of making inappropriate comments during a work call.\n\nCuomo has denied all allegations of inappropriate behavior. In a statement, his lawyer said, \"Chris acknowledges that he acted inappropriately during this consensual interaction. It was not sexual in nature and he took responsibility for it at the time.\"\n\nThe incident with Shelley Ross is a setback for Chris Cuomo, who has built a reputation as a tenacious interviewer and a trusted news anchor. His handling of the situation will be closely watched by his colleagues and his audience."}

However, as history shows us, powerful figures such as senior military officials and CIA officers involved in past abuses have historically managed to evade prosecution. This lenient approach towards those in power raises valid concerns about whether Trump, or any U.S. president for that matter, will truly face serious legal repercussions for their actions.\n\nThe argument that unity and moving forward is a justification for not pursuing legal action against political elites is not without merit. Yet, this stance, now advocated by some Republicans, fails to acknowledge the necessity of holding those accountable who have incited violence and challenged the very foundation of our democracy. The events leading to the Capitol riot were predictable, given Trump's long-standing pattern of inciting violence and empowering extremist supporters through divisive rhetoric.\n\nTrump's role in encouraging the Capitol riot, coupled with the involvement of law enforcement and other officials in facilitating the event, is under intense scrutiny. The rioters themselves believed they were acting on Trump's orders, a reflection of his immense influence over his supporters and the exceptionalism they felt in their actions. As the investigation unfolds, it's crucial to remember that accountability is not just about punishing individuals; it's about upholding the principles that define our society.\n\nDespite broad agreement on the need to hold perpetrators accountable, skepticism lingers regarding the prospect of senior figures, including Trump, facing significant legal consequences. It's worth noting that Trump may face prosecution for a range of offenses outside his presidency, but it remains uncertain whether his actions as president will lead to meaningful legal repercussions.\n\nIn light of past failures to prosecute senior officials, it's essential that we as a society commit to holding U.S. presidents accountable for their actions. As we move forward, it's crucial to reflect on the importance of not repeating these mistakes with Trump. The Capitol riot serves as a stark reminder that the erosion of accountability and checks and balances can have dire consequences for our democracy. It's time for justice to be served, not just for the sake of accountability, but for the future of our nation."}

Peter Meijer (R-MI) and Seth Moulton (D-MA) conducted oversight on the U.S. evacuation operation amid the military withdrawal and Taliban takeover.\n\nMeijer and Moulton, both military veterans and members of the House Armed Services Committee, defended their trip against accusations that it was an unnecessary and dangerous \"freelance\" journey. In an interview, Meijer stated, \"We wanted to come and assess the situation on the ground, understand what resources are needed, and provide guidance and recommendations to the administration.\"\n\nAs the U.S. military prepares to meet the August 31 deadline for troop withdrawal, the Biden administration claims that over 100,000 people have been safely evacuated. However, Moulton, who served in Iraq, expressed concern over the conditions at Kabul airport, stating, \"The situation is emotionally and physically draining for our personnel on the ground. The administration must do more to ensure the safety and security of those trying to leave.\"\n\nThe House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, weighed in on the controversy, criticizing the lawmakers' trip as a potential distraction from the evacuation efforts. \"The focus should be on getting Americans and our allies out of harm's way, not on freelance journeys that could divert resources,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nDespite the criticisms, Meijer and Moulton emphasized that their visit was not pre-announced to minimize the potential risk to operations and people on the ground. Politico reported that the lawmakers paid for their flights to the United Arab Emirates out of pocket but took military flights to and from Kabul.\n\nMoulton also took the opportunity to critique President Biden's preparation for evacuations, stating, \"The administration was not transparent about its plans for evacuating thousands of Afghans who worked alongside our military and diplomats. We need a clearer and more comprehensive evacuation strategy.\"\n\nThe Biden administration and Pelosi's criticisms raised questions about the role of congressional oversight in times of crisis. Meijer responded, \"We have a responsibility to ensure that the resources allocated by the American people are being used effectively and efficiently. That's what we were doing in Kabul.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding Meijer and Moulton's trip comes at a time when the U.S. and its allies are under immense pressure to evacuate thousands of people before the Taliban's deadline for foreign troops to leave Afghanistan. The situation remains fluid, with many uncertainties and challenges.\n\nIn a joint statement, Meijer and Moulton shared their opposition to the Biden administration's plan to meet the August 31 deadline for troop withdrawal, stating, \"We urge the administration to reconsider this arbitrary deadline and prioritize the safety and security of all those who are at risk.\"\n\nAs the situation in Afghanistan continues to unfold, the debate over Meijer and Moulton's surprise visit to Kabul will likely persist, with some viewing it as an essential exercise in congressional oversight and others as an unwarranted distraction.\n\nMeijer concluded, \"Our job as members of Congress is to represent the American people and ensure that their tax dollars are being used effectively. That's exactly what we were doing in Kabul.\"\n\nMoulton echoed Meijer's sentiments, adding, \"We'll continue to advocate for the safety and security of all those who are at risk, and we'll do so with the utmost respect for the men and women on the ground who are working tirelessly to evacuate thousands of people.\"\n\nDespite the criticism, Meijer and Moulton remain steadfast in their commitment to providing oversight and advocating for those in need during this critical time in U.S. history. Their surprise visit to Kabul may have stirred controversy, but it also underscores the importance of congressional oversight in times of crisis.\n\nIn conclusion, the surprise visit by Reps. Peter Meijer and Seth Moulton to Kabul amidst the U.S. military withdrawal and Taliban takeover raised eyebrows and controversy, with critics labeling it a dangerous \"freelance\" journey. However, Meijer and Moulton, both veterans and members of the House Armed Services Committee, defended their trip as an essential exercise in congressional oversight aimed at assessing the situation on the ground, understanding resource needs, and providing guidance to the administration. The debate over the role of congressional oversight in times of crisis will likely persist as the U.S. and its allies work to evacuate thousands of people before the Taliban's deadline for foreign troops to leave Afghanistan. As the situation remains fluid, Meijer and Moulton remain steadfast in their commitment to advocating for the safety and security of all those at risk."}

The signing ceremony took place in the Oval Office, a day earlier than initially planned, with a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders joining Biden for the historic moment.\n\n\"Today, I'm signing into law the American Rescue Plan, a bill that will change the lives of millions of Americans,\" Biden said, surrounded by members of Congress. \"Help is here.\"\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Ron Klain emphasized the importance of the legislation for working and middle-class individuals, stating, \"This bill is about rebuilding the backbone of this country. It's about putting money in the pockets of the American people.\"\n\nBiden's top legislative priority since taking office in January, the relief package includes direct payments of up to $1,400 for most households, a $300 boost to weekly jobless benefits, and an expanded child tax credit. Additionally, it allocates $350 billion for state and local aid, funds for K-12 schools, small businesses, and Covid-19 vaccine distribution.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced that stimulus checks could start appearing in bank accounts as early as the coming weekend, providing much-needed relief to millions of struggling Americans. \"The president understands the urgency of getting this money out the door and into the hands of the American people,\" Psaki said.\n\nBiden also announced plans to deliver his first prime-time address marking the one-year anniversary of the Covid-19 pandemic shutdown on March 11. The address will acknowledge the pandemic's impact and outline steps to combat the virus, offering a hopeful vision for the future.\n\n\"I want to speak to the American people tonight about where we've been, where we are, and where we're going,\" Biden said. \"We've been through so much in the past year. We've lost so much. But we've also come so far.\"\n\nThe relief package also includes $14 billion for Covid-19 vaccine research, distribution, and administration efforts. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, expressed optimism that the funding would significantly accelerate the nation's vaccination campaign.\n\n\"This infusion of funding will enable us to not only increase the pace of vaccinations but also to expand the places where vaccines are available,\" Fauci said.\n\nBiden's signing of the relief bill comes as the US continues to battle the Covid-19 pandemic, with new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths still rising in some parts of the country. The administration is working closely with state and local leaders to distribute vaccines and ramp up testing and contact tracing efforts.\n\nBiden emphasized the importance of unity and collaboration in addressing the crisis. \"It's going to take all of us working together to get through this crisis,\" he said. \"That's what the American Rescue Plan is all about – coming together as a nation to help those most in need.\""}

Woods spent almost three weeks in the hospital undergoing emergency surgery and intensive rehabilitation.\n\nThe accident occurred on the morning of Feb. 23, when Woods' SUV sheared through a tree and landed in the brush with major damage. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported that there was no evidence that Woods attempted to prevent the crash.\n\nWoods was unconscious immediately following the crash and had no recollection of driving or how the accident happened. The incident sent shockwaves through the sports world and beyond, as fans and well-wishers held their breath for news of the golfing great's condition.\n\nDespite the serious nature of his injuries, Woods is in good spirits and focused on his recovery, according to his team. \"Tiger is recovering at home and is focused on his recovery. His family and friends are incredibly grateful for the outpouring of support and prayers,\" a spokesperson for Woods said in a statement.\n\nThe surgery, which took place at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center before Woods was transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for continued care, was a success, according to reports. Woods spent several days in intensive care before being moved to a private room.\n\nThe nature of Woods' injuries have not been disclosed in detail, but it is understood that they are orthopedic in nature and affect his right lower extremity. The full extent of the damage and the length of his recovery period are not yet known.\n\nWoods' team has provided regular updates on his condition, with the latest statement confirming that he is making progress in his rehabilitation. \"Tiger continues to make progress and is focusing on his recovery. He and his family are grateful for the overwhelming support they have received,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nWoods' wife Elin Nordegren, with whom he has two children, Charlie Axel, 12, and Sam Alexis, 11, has been by his side throughout his hospitalization and recovery. The family is reportedly \"grateful for the outpouring of support and prayers\" from fans and well-wishers.\n\nWoods' accident came at a difficult time for the golfing icon, who was going through a public divorce from Nordegren at the time. The couple had announced their separation in 2009, and their divorce was finalized in 2010.\n\nDespite the challenges in his personal life, Woods remained a dominant force in golf, winning five Masters titles and 15 major championships in total. His comeback from injury and scandal in 2019, when he won the Masters for the fifth time, was a testament to his resilience and determination.\n\nWoods' accident was a reminder of the fragility of life and the risks that come with fame and fortune. It also served as a reminder of the importance of safety on the roads, with many calling for increased awareness of the dangers of distracted driving.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is continuing to investigate the cause of the accident, with toxicology reports yet to be released. It is not yet known whether Woods was under the influence of any substances at the time of the crash.\n\nWoods' accident was not the first time he had been involved in a high-profile car crash. In 2009, he was involved in a scandal involving multiple extramarital affairs, which led to a loss of sponsorships and a period of public humiliation.\n\nWoods' supporters have rallied around him in the wake of the accident, with many expressing their well-wishes and prayers for his recovery. \"Tiger Woods is a true legend and an inspiration to millions of people around the world.

The pipeline, which supplies about 45% of the East Coast's fuel, was not subjected to a mandatory, in-depth cybersecurity review by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) before the attack.\n\n\"Colonial Pipeline Company is not a regulated entity under the Transportation Security Administration's pipeline security regulations,\" said Kevin Feeney, a spokesman for Colonial Pipeline, in a statement. \"The company has robust cybersecurity measures in place designed to mitigate risks.\"\n\nHowever, Representative Jim Langevin (D-R.I., Co-founder of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus) expressed his concerns about the lack of mandatory cybersecurity reviews for pipeline companies. \"It's clear that voluntary compliance with cybersecurity guidelines has not been sufficient to protect our critical infrastructure from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats,\" Langevin said.\n\nIn response to the Colonial Pipeline attack, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas emphasized the importance of adapting to new and emerging threats in cybersecurity. \"We need to evolve our approach to cybersecurity to meet the challenges of the 21st century,\" Mayorkas said during a press conference.\n\nThe TSA has historically partnered with the energy industry to set voluntary cybersecurity guidelines, without penalties for non-compliance. Jack Fox, head of TSA's pipeline security program, acknowledged the need for change. \"We recognize that the threat landscape has evolved, and we are working closely with our partners to enhance pipeline cybersecurity,\" Fox said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is moving towards implementing mandatory rules for pipeline cybersecurity after decades of voluntary guidelines. Michael Chertoff, former Secretary of Homeland Security, believes that mandatory rules are necessary to protect critical infrastructure. \"Voluntary guidelines have not been enough to secure our pipelines against cyber threats,\" Chertoff said. \"It's time for mandatory regulations.\"\n\nAs of late 2018, only 23 comprehensive cybersecurity assessments (VADR) were conducted by the TSA on pipeline companies. Gary Forman, director of corporate security at NiSource Inc., which operates natural gas pipelines, emphasized the importance of regular cybersecurity assessments. \"Cybersecurity is an ongoing process, not a one-time event,\" Forman said.\n\nTim Conway, an industrial control systems cybersecurity instructor at the SANS Institute, agrees that mandatory cybersecurity rules are necessary. \"The Colonial Pipeline attack is a wake-up call for the energy industry,\" Conway said. \"It's time for mandatory cybersecurity regulations to protect our critical infrastructure.\"\n\nColonial Pipeline has reportedly increased its IT spending by about 50% since 2017, hiring independent firms for cybersecurity risk assessments. However, the shift to mandatory cybersecurity measures comes amid growing ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure.\n\nDespite the authority to enforce mandatory rules, the TSA has relied on voluntary compliance, influenced by industry resistance to regulation. \"The energy industry has historically resisted regulation, and the TSA has been reluctant to enforce mandatory rules,\" said a former TSA official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"But the Colonial Pipeline attack shows that voluntary compliance is not enough to protect our critical infrastructure from cyber threats.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack has highlighted the need for mandatory cybersecurity rules for pipeline companies. With growing cyber threats targeting critical infrastructure, it's time for the TSA to take a more proactive approach to pipeline cybersecurity. As Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas said, \"We need to evolve our approach to cybersecurity to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\""}

Nearly 700,000 firearms were attempted to be bought during this period, according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nThe surge in gun sales comes as the country grapples with the aftermath of the Oxford High School shooting in Michigan, where a 15-year-old student opened fire, killing four classmates and injuring seven others. The pistol used in the shooting was bought on Black Friday by the suspect's father.\n\nThe 2021 Black Friday ranks among the top 10 highest days for firearm background checks since 1998. This trend has reignited debates over gun safety and laws in Michigan, where the shooting occurred.\n\nMichigan Governor, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer, referred to gun violence as a 'public health crisis' in a statement, urging lawmakers to take action. \"Enough is enough,\" Whitmer said. \"It's time for common-sense gun safety laws that keep our communities safe.\"\n\nMeshawn Maddock, co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party, expressed support for armed teachers. \"Teachers should have the right to protect themselves and their students,\" Maddock said. \"Arming teachers is a responsible solution to keep our schools safe.\"\n\nThe Oxford High School shooting is considered the sixth mass shooting in 2021, contrasting with only two in 2020. According to the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit organization that tracks gun violence in the U.S., there have been 613 mass shootings in the country so far this year.\n\nThe incident comes as support for stricter gun control has diminished, with only 52% of Americans in favor, according to a Gallup poll. In contrast, 47% of Americans oppose stricter gun control laws.\n\nThe Giffords Law Center, a non-profit organization that advocates for gun safety, ranks Michigan 20th among states with the strictest gun laws. Michigan law allows concealed carry without a permit, and open carry is permitted with some restrictions.\n\nDemocrats in Michigan have introduced several gun control bills, including universal background checks, red flag laws, and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. However, these bills face an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled legislature.\n\nRepublicans argue that stricter gun control laws would not prevent mass shootings and would infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. \"We need to focus on mental health and addressing the root causes of gun violence, not restricting law-abiding citizens' access to firearms,\" said Representative Matt Maddock, Meshawn's husband and a Michigan Republican.\n\nThe debate over gun safety and laws in Michigan comes as the country grapples with a rise in gun violence. According to the FBI, there were 14,542 gun homicides in the U.S. in 2020, a 30% increase from the previous year.\n\nGun violence is not just an urban problem. According to a report by the Violence Policy Center, rural areas accounted for 58% of all gun deaths in the U.S. in 2019.\n\nThe Oxford High School shooting is a reminder that gun violence can happen anywhere, and the debate over gun safety and laws will continue to be a contentious issue in the U.S.\n\n\"We need to find common ground and work together to keep our communities safe,\" Whitmer said. \"Gun violence is a public health crisis, and it's time for action.\"\n\nMaddock added, \"We need to focus on solutions that respect the Second Amendment while keeping our schools and communities safe.\"\n\nAs the investigation into the Oxford High School shooting continues, it remains to be seen what, if any, legislative action will be taken in Michigan. However, one thing is clear: the debate over gun safety and laws will continue to be a contentious issue in the U.S. for the foreseeable future."}

The social media giant's six-month investigation identified six firms and one unnamed Chinese entity involved in the global surveillance industry, primarily based in Israel. In a statement, Elad Sharon, CEO of Cognyte, celebrated the company's first trading day on Nasdaq, highlighting its impressive annual revenues, global workforce, and diverse client base, which included the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe targeted entities utilized social media to gather intelligence, often by establishing fake accounts and manipulating targets to compromise their devices. Approximately 1,500 accounts linked to these operations were taken down, and around 50,000 people in 100 countries were notified of being targeted. In addition to Cognyte, Facebook named Israeli firms Cobwebs Technologies, Black Cube, and Bluehawk CI, India's BellTroX, and North Macedonia's Cytrox as part of the industry.

Black Cube, one of the named Israeli firms, stated it does not engage in hacking or phishing, emphasizing its compliance with local laws in its operations. However, Bill Marczak, a security researcher at Citizen Lab, stressed the pervasive risks of mercenary spyware in political repression, as evidenced by the lab's recent report on Cytrox's Predator spyware.

(AP) – Pauline Bauer, the outspoken owner of the Red Bud Restaurant in this small western Pennsylvania town, is facing backlash and partisan bickering after her arrest for participating in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6. Bauer and her longtime friend, William Blauser Jr., were among the more than 600 people charged in connection to the storming of the Capitol.\n\nBauer, 58, was recorded shouting at police during the riot, demanding they bring out House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to be hanged. The arrests of Bauer and Blauser, who have been friends since childhood, have deeply divided Kane, a town that strongly supported former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nJoe Lanich, owner of The Laughing Owl Press Co., a local printing business, expressed his disappointment with Bauer's actions. \"She's always been a good friend, but this goes against everything I stand for,\" Lanich said. \"It's a shame to see someone I've known for so long involved in something like this.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, Bauer maintains that her actions haven't harmed her friendships or business, with regular customers continuing to support her. \"I've been an outspoken critic of the government's response to COVID-19 and the lockdown measures,\" Bauer said. \"My customers know where I stand, and they support me for it.\"\n\nBrandy Schimp, the mayor of Kane, urged unity in the community. \"We need to come together as a town and focus on the things that unite us, rather than the things that divide us,\" Schimp said.\n\nGlenn Robinson, a lifelong resident of Kane, expressed his concern about the town's reputation. \"It's not good for Kane to be in the national spotlight for something like this,\" Robinson said. \"We're known for our friendly people and beautiful scenery, not for storming the Capitol.\"\n\nThe division over the Capitol riot reflects broader political splits, with significant differences in views across party lines. In Kane, many still display pro-Trump signs, and some residents have expressed support for Bauer and Blauser.\n\nBauer and Blauser were arrested in May, and video evidence shows them entering the Capitol and participating in the riot. Blauser, who has advised Bauer to avoid him due to the controversy, continues to support her. \"She's my friend, and I believe in her innocence,\" Blauser said.\n\nThe cases of those charged in the Capitol riot are proceeding, with some already pleading guilty or being sentenced. Bauer and Blauser are scheduled to appear in court later this year.\n\nThe arrests of Bauer and Blauser have raised questions about the role of friendship in the face of political differences.

Eligibility mainly targeted those with work income in 2020 or who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI).\n\nAndrew Imparato, Executive Director of Disability Rights California, criticized California for not adequately supporting its disabled residents during the pandemic. \"The exclusion of SSDI recipients from the Golden State Stimulus is unacceptable,\" Imparato said. \"These individuals, many of whom live in poverty and face additional medical expenses, need financial assistance now more than ever.\"\n\nH.D. Palmer, a Department of Finance spokesperson, acknowledged the logistical challenges in including SSDI recipients in the stimulus payments due to lack of access to federal records. \"We understand the concerns raised by disability advocates,\" Palmer stated. \"However, given the complexities and limitations of the federal data we have access to, it was not feasible to include SSDI recipients in this round of stimulus payments.\"\n\nCharis Hill, a disabled activist and freelance writer from Sacramento, managed to qualify for the stimulus by filing taxes for her freelance work. \"It's unfair and unjust that some of us were able to qualify while others were left out,\" Hill emphasized. \"SSDI recipients deserve financial assistance just as much as those with work income.\"\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom initially announced the Golden State Stimulus in January, with several changes and expansions occurring over the following months. In April, the eligibility criteria were expanded to include more Californians, but SSDI recipients were still excluded.\n\n\"I'm angry and frustrated,\" Sydney Chandler, a caretaker for her cousin with severe disabilities, expressed. \"Caretakers already bear significant financial burdens, and this exclusion just adds to our struggles.\"\n\nImparato remains hopeful that SSDI recipients will be included in future stimulus payments. \"Negotiations over the state budget are ongoing, and we will continue advocating for the inclusion of SSDI recipients in any additional relief packages,\" he said.\n\nDespite the exclusion, SSDI recipients often face financial hardships. According to the National Organization of Social Security Disability Advocates, over 70% of SSDI recipients live below the federal poverty line.\n\n\"The pandemic has made things even more challenging for me,\" Clendenin shared. \"I've had to cut back on essentials just to make ends meet. This stimulus could have made a significant difference in my life.\"\n\nImparato emphasized the importance of including SSDI recipients in future relief efforts. \"California has an opportunity to lead the way in supporting its most vulnerable residents,\" he concluded. \"We urge the state to reconsider and include SSDI recipients in any future stimulus payments.\""}

Their daughter, Levi Rylee Rose McCollum, arrived weighing a healthy 8 lbs., 10 oz.\n\nThe joyous occasion was tinged with profound sadness, as Rylee McCollum, a 20-year-old Marine, had been killed just over two weeks prior in the devastating attack on the Kabul airport on August 26. More than 170 people, including over 13 U.S. service members and over 100 civilians, lost their lives in the assault, which was claimed by ISIS-K, a branch of the Islamic State.\n\nThe birth of Levi Rylee Rose was announced on Facebook by both Jiennah and her mother, Jill Miller Crayton, who shared heartfelt messages expressing their love and gratitude for the outpouring of support from friends, family, and strangers alike.\n\nRylee McCollum's untimely death came as a shock to all who knew him. A passionate and dedicated Marine, he had aspired to join the Corps since he was just three years old. His dream became a reality when he graduated from high school in 2019 and enlisted.\n\nThe Kabul airport attack, which unfolded as the U.S. and its allies were working to evacuate thousands of Afghans and Americans from the war-torn country, was a chaotic and harrowing scene. Amidst the mayhem, Rylee McCollum and his fellow Marines were providing security, ensuring the safe passage of as many people as possible.\n\nIn an emotional Facebook post, Jiennah mourned the loss of her beloved husband and lamented the fact that he would not be there to meet and care for their newborn daughter. \"My heart is absolutely broken,\" she wrote, \"but Levi Rylee Rose will know how much her daddy loved her.\"\n\nThe tragic loss of Rylee McCollum and other U.S. service members has sparked an outpouring of support for their families. A GoFundMe campaign, set up to help cover the costs of raising Levi Rylee Rose and supporting Jiennah during this difficult time, has raised over $675,000 as of this writing.\n\nAs the world mourns the senseless loss of life in the Kabul airport attack, the story of Rylee McCollum and his newborn daughter serves as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by the brave men and women who serve our country.\n\nThe U.S. military has identified the other service members who were killed in the attack, and their families have also been notified. The names of the civilians who perished have not been released at this time.\n\nThe attack on the Kabul airport marked the end of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, which began following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. As the U.S. and its allies move forward, the memory of Rylee McCollum and the other brave service members who lost their lives in the line of duty will not be forgotten."}

The pipeline, which transports gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel from Texas to New Jersey, was forced to shut down following the attack.\n\nGovernors in North Carolina and Virginia have declared states of emergency to help ensure gas supply and access. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper urged residents not to panic buy and report gas price gouging. Seventy-one percent of gas stations in North Carolina reported having no gas as of Thursday, according to the North Carolina Department of Transportation.\n\n\"It's crazy out there,\" said tow-truck driver Jonathan King. \"I've been working non-stop trying to help people get fuel for their cars or trucks. It's a mess.\"\n\nColonial Pipeline initiated restart operations on Wednesday, but the company stated deliveries to normal would take several days. Mike Whalen, Vice President of the Whalen Corporation, which operates more than 100 convenience stores and 60 gas stations in the Southeast, described the situation as \"chaotic.\"\n\n\"There's been a real sense of urgency among our customers,\" Whalen said. \"We've seen lines forming at our stations as soon as trucks arrive with fuel. It's a challenging situation, but we're doing our best to keep up with demand.\"\n\nIncidents of violence have occurred at gas stations due to tensions over gas availability. Jeanette McGee, a spokeswoman for AAA auto club, warned against such behavior. \"We understand that people are frustrated, but violence is not the answer,\" McGee said. \"We're asking everyone to remain calm and patient as we work through this situation.\"\n\nThe cyberattack has raised concerns about the vulnerability of the nation's critical infrastructure. \"This is a wake-up call for us all,\" Cooper said in a press conference. \"We need to be prepared for these types of incidents and work together to mitigate their impact.\"\n\nThe attack highlighted a transportation issue rather than a lack of fuel supply. According to the American Petroleum Institute, there is ample fuel available for the summer. However, the pipeline shutdown has disrupted the supply chain, leading to fuel shortages in certain areas.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline cyberattack is not the first incident of its kind. In 2016, Ukraine's power grid was targeted in a cyberattack that caused widespread power outages. In 2012, Iran's nuclear program was targeted in a cyberattack that is believed to have been carried out by the United States and Israel.\n\nKing, the tow-truck driver, expressed concern about the impact of the pipeline shutdown on his livelihood. \"I've been in this business for a long time, and I've never seen anything like this,\" he said. \"I just hope we can get back to normal soon. I've got bills to pay like everyone else.\"\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, government officials and industry experts are working to address the fuel shortages and restore normalcy to the affected areas. In the meantime, residents are being urged to remain patient and avoid panic buying.\n\n\"We're all in this together,\" Whalen said. \"We'll get through this, but it's going to take some time. In the meantime, let's be kind to each other and do our best to help those in need.\"\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline cyberattack serves as a reminder of the importance of cybersecurity and the potential consequences of a successful attack on critical infrastructure. As the situation continues to evolve, it is essential that all stakeholders remain vigilant and work together to mitigate the impact on the affected communities."}

(AP) – The Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, restarted operations Sunday following a hacker-induced shutdown that led to widespread gas shortages, panic-buying, and long lines at gas stations across the Southeast.\n\nColonial Pipeline Company said in a statement that it had taken the unprecedented step to proactively take certain cybersecurity systems offline to contain the threat from the ransomware attack. The company added that it had begun the process of restarting its pipeline system.\n\n\"Based on the current understanding of the situation, it will take several days for the product delivery supply chain to return to normal,\" the company said.\n\nJeanette McGee, a spokeswoman for the American Automobile Association (AAA), warned that it would take time for fuel deliveries to normalize.\n\n\"Motorists in the Southeast should not panic,\" McGee said. \"But they should be prepared for potential gas shortages and long lines at the pump.\"\n\nThe cyberattack did not allow hackers to control pipeline operations, but the shutdown led to a transportation issue affecting fuel supply to gas stations.

The price increase was due in part to the Colonial Pipeline shutdown, but also to rising crude oil prices and increasing demand for fuel as more Americans get vaccinated against COVID-19 and return to work.\n\nMcGee urged consumers to avoid panic-buying and hoarding fuel, which could exacerbate the shortages.\n\n\"We understand that people are concerned about the situation,\" McGee said. \"But we ask that they please be patient and only buy the fuel they need.\"\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline shutdown was the latest in a series of cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure in the United States and around the world.

The 43-year-old quarterback led his team to a 31-9 triumph over the Kansas City Chiefs, securing his seventh NFL championship title.\n\nBrady's latest Super Bowl win marked a significant milestone in his remarkable career. Having previously claimed six Super Bowl titles with the New England Patriots from 2001 to 2019, Brady became the first player in NFL history to win championships with two different teams.\n\nWith Super Bowl LV, Brady etched his name in the record books as the quarterback with the most Super Bowl victories. The four-time MVP's impressive record surpassed the previous record held by Pittsburgh Steelers legend, Terry Bradshaw, who won the title four times between 1974 and 1980.\n\nBrady's record-breaking performance did not stop at championship titles. He also holds the record for the most Super Bowl appearances, making his 10th appearance in this prestigious event. This achievement further highlights Brady's incredible consistency and longevity in the league.\n\nThe Tampa Bay quarterback has not only won the most Super Bowl titles but also the most Super Bowl MVP awards, totaling a remarkable five. Brady first claimed the MVP award in Super Bowl XXXVI, and he has continued to dominate on the big stage ever since.\n\nBrady's accomplishments did not go unnoticed during Super Bowl LV. With three touchdowns in the game, Brady extended his Super Bowl touchdown passes record to 21, surpassing the previous record held by Ben Roethlisberger.\n\nMoreover, Brady holds the record for the most Super Bowl passing yards, with a cumulative 3,039 yards. The 43-year-old quarterback's impressive performance during Super Bowl LV added another 505 passing yards to his impressive tally.\n\nBrady made history in Super Bowl LV by setting single-game Super Bowl records for the most pass attempts (62), completions (43), and passing yards (505). These records serve as a testament to Brady's exceptional talent and resilience.\n\nBrady also holds the records for the most 300-yard passing games (4) and game-winning drives (6) in Super Bowl history. These achievements demonstrate his ability to excel under pressure and perform at the highest level when it matters most.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers' Super Bowl LV victory also marked an impressive achievement for Brady as the oldest quarterback to win a Super Bowl title at the age of 43.\n\nBrady's unparalleled success in the Super Bowl is a testament to his unwavering dedication and commitment to the game. His ability to consistently perform at the highest level, even in the face of adversity, has solidified his position as the greatest quarterback in NFL history.\n\nBrady's impressive career has spanned over two decades, with his first Super Bowl victory coming in 2001. His ability to win championships in three separate decades is an accomplishment few athletes have achieved.\n\nBrady's journey to Super Bowl LV was not an easy one. He joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020 after spending 20 years with the New England Patriots. The veteran quarterback's decision to leave his longtime team and join a new organization raised questions about his ability to adapt and lead a new team to victory.\n\nDespite the challenges, Brady proved his critics wrong by leading the Buccaneers to the Super Bowl and delivering a championship title to the franchise's faithful fans.\n\nBrady's impressive performance in Super Bowl LV was not only a testament to his talent and determination but also a reflection of his leadership abilities. He rallied his teammates and guided them through the highs and lows of the season, ultimately leading them to victory.\n\nAs Tom Brady continues to defy the odds and rewrite the record books, there is no denying that he has solidified his position as the greatest quarterback in NFL history. His accomplishments on the field, both with the New England Patriots and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, will be remembered for generations to come."}

This incident is not an isolated case; it is part of a growing trend of cyber-attacks targeting companies, federal agencies, and municipalities in the United States.\n\nGlenn Gerstell, the recent former general counsel for the National Security Agency (NSA), recently stated, \"We're under attack all the time. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when and how bad.\" (Source: CNBC)\n\nEighty-five percent of American critical infrastructure is privately owned, leaving it with limited direct governmental protection against cyber threats. While federal agencies like the NSA, FBI, and DHS play essential roles in cyber-defense, no single agency is tasked with protecting the public from hackers.\n\nA bill to establish security standards for critical infrastructure, known as the Secure It Act, failed in the Senate in 2012. This legislative gap in cyber-defense is concerning, considering the potential economic and national security consequences of a successful attack.\n\nExperts advocate for more government-corporation collaboration and information sharing to improve cyber-defense. Gerstell echoes this sentiment, stating, \"The government needs to be sharing threat intelligence with the private sector and the private sector needs to be sharing threat intelligence with the government.\" (Source: CNBC)\n\nLegislation is needed to protect companies from liability when disclosing hacks, encouraging them to report incidents promptly. This would allow for a more coordinated and effective response to cyber-attacks.\n\nHowever, companies negligent in protecting customer data or critical infrastructure should face liability. This would provide an incentive for organizations to invest in robust cyber-defense measures.\n\nThe Biden administration's $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan includes funds to address critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. This investment in cybersecurity is crucial to prevent economic disruptions and safeguard national security.\n\nThe proliferation of 5G and IoT devices increases the importance of robust cyber-defense. These technologies offer numerous benefits but also come with significant risks. As Gerstell puts it, \"The cyber threat is going to get worse before it gets better.\" (Source: CNBC)\n\nThe cyber-attack on Colonial Pipeline serves as a wake-up call for the United States. It is time for the government and the private sector to work together to strengthen cyber-defenses and protect critical infrastructure from the ever-evolving threat of cyber-attacks.\n\nGerstell concludes, \"We're going to need a combination of technological solutions, legal solutions, regulatory solutions, and cultural solutions to address the cyber threat.\" (Source: CNBC)\n\nIn conclusion, the cyber-attack on the Colonial Pipeline underscores the need for increased collaboration between the government and the private sector to strengthen cyber-defenses and protect critical infrastructure from the growing threat of cyber-attacks.

Holding back tears, she passionately argued for the potential ban of then-President Donald Trump's account, citing his role in inciting violence that had left the nation reeling.\n\n\"We cannot let incitement to violence stay on our platform,\" Gadde pleaded, according to a source within the company. \"We cannot be a part of this.\"\n\nHowever, Twitter's workforce was far from united. Employees voiced concerns about their safety due to security threats and frustration that Trump's account had been reinstated after a 12-hour suspension. One staff member, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, admitted, \"We all felt violated, not just by the rioters, but by the company's handling of the situation.\"\n\nOn January 8, Twitter finally made the historic decision to ban Trump. The move marked the end of an era for the platform, which had long championed perceived online free speech. Twitter's CEO and Founder, Jack Dorsey, acknowledged the implications, stating in a tweet, \"After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.\"\n\nDespite the necessity of the decision, Dorsey expressed regret over its potential impact on the open internet. \"I believe this was the right decision for Twitter,\" he told the Washington Post, his voice laced with sadness. \"We will do our part to help promote a healthy conversational environment on Twitter, and to that end, we will continue to be transparent around our policies and enforcement actions.\"\n\nThe ban sparked international dialogue on social media's power and the potential need for regulatory oversight. European Union Commissioner Thierry Breton tweeted, \"Social media are private companies, not public utilities. Yet, they have a huge impact on our democracies. They must assume their responsibilities.\"\n\nFollowing the ban, Twitter purged approximately 70,000 accounts associated with the QAnon conspiracy theory, leading to criticism from conservatives over tech companies' unchecked power. In response, Dorsey stated, \"We've been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm.\"\n\nTwitter's hesitant approach to content policing had evolved over the years, culminating in policies and features such as warning labels for rule-breaking yet newsworthy tweets. Trump's use of Twitter for misinformation and incitements had long posed a challenge, leading to increased measures to label and block misleading content, especially around the election.\n\nGadde defended the decision to ban Trump, stating, \"We believe the risks associated with allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are much greater than the risks of removing his account from our service.\"\n\nThe decision to ban Trump will have lasting implications for debates on free speech, the role of social media in public discourse, and the balance between online safety and expression. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the lines between public and private communication, as well as the responsibilities of tech companies and governments, will remain topics of intense discussion.\n\nDorsey acknowledged the weight of Twitter's decision, stating, \"We know that banning an account holds different implications for different people, but our responsibility is to promote a healthy conversational environment where individuals feel safe expressing their opinions and ideas.\""}

Before her involvement in the riot, Babbitt's life was a complex tapestry of personal and financial struggles.\n\nBabbitt's military career, which spanned over a decade, was marked by discipline issues and insubordination, leading to her discharge as a senior airman in 2004. Her post-military life was marred by debts and financial hardships.\n\nOn the day of the riot, Babbitt, clad in tactical gear, was among the mob that stormed the Capitol building. She gained notoriety when she was shot by Capitol Police as she attempted to leap through the broken window of a door.\n\nBabbitt's military records revealed a promising start. She enlisted in the Air Force in 1997 and was stationed at Dyess Air Force Base in Texas. However, her disciplinary issues began to surface, leading to a series of reprimands and administrative actions.\n\nBabbitt's troubles continued even after her discharge from the military. Court records showed that she and her husband, Aaron, were involved in a heated confrontation with his ex-wife in 2012. The incident resulted in protective orders against Babbitt.\n\nBabbitt's financial woes began to pile up. She and her husband filed for bankruptcy in 2010, listing over $100,000 in debts. Their financial situation did not improve in the following years.\n\nAs Trump's presidency neared its end, Babbitt's belief in conspiracy theories, particularly QAnon, intensified. She believed in the myth that January 6 would be 'the storm' when Trump would capture and execute his opponents.\n\nBabbitt's social media activity, which was replete with pro-Trump and QAnon posts, painted a picture of a woman who was deeply entrenched in the conspiracy theories. Her posts became increasingly confrontational and radical as the election neared.\n\nThe transformation from a military service member to a participant in one of democracy's most grievous attacks was a complex journey fueled by paranoia and conspiratorial beliefs.\n\nBabbitt's involvement in the Capitol riot and subsequent death turned her into a martyr figure for some within the movement she supported. Her image was splashed across social media platforms, often accompanied by tributes and calls for action.\n\nThe day of the riot began peacefully for Babbitt. She traveled from her home in San Diego to Washington, D.C., to demonstrate her support for Trump. However, as the situation at the Capitol deteriorated, she became increasingly agitated.\n\nBabbitt was among the crowd that breached the Capitol building, pushing past law enforcement officers and shattering windows. She was seen on video attempting to enter the building through a broken window, but was shot by police as she tried to leap through.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Babbitt's death remain unclear. The Capitol Police have not released many details about the shooting, citing an ongoing investigation. Her death ignited a firestorm of controversy, with some questioning the necessity of using lethal force against an unarmed woman.\n\nBabbitt's family released a statement expressing their grief and disbelief over her death. They described her as a devoted mother, wife, and friend. They also condemned the violence that unfolded at the Capitol.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol was not the first time Babbitt had been involved in confrontational behavior. Her court records showed that she and her husband had been involved in a car chase and collision with his ex-wife in 2012. The incident resulted in protective orders against Babbitt.\n\nBabbitt's social media activity revealed a woman who was deeply distrustful of the government and the mainstream media. She believed in a vast conspiracy to undermine Trump and his supporters. Her posts often contained baseless claims and inflammatory language.\n\nBabbitt's radicalization was a gradual process. Her transformation from a military service member to a conspiracy theorist was fueled by a sense of grievance and a deep-seated mistrust of authority.\n\nThe Capitol riot was not an isolated incident. Babbitt's involvement in the violence was part of a larger trend of political extremism that has been gaining momentum in recent years.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol was a stark reminder of the dangers of extremist ideologies. Babbitt's death was a tragic reminder of the human cost of these beliefs.\n\nThe investigation into Babbitt's death is ongoing. The Capitol Police have not released many details about the shooting, citing an ongoing investigation. Her family has called for transparency and accountability."}

Homes were destroyed, infrastructure was damaged, and lives were disrupted. The storm's impact extended to the Gulf of Mexico, where oil slicks began appearing off the coast of Louisiana, near Port Fourchon, raising concerns about potential pipeline damage.\n\nFederal and state agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the state of Louisiana, and the National Ocean Service, have assessed over 1,500 reports of pollution following Hurricane Ida. Nearly 350 incidents have been prioritized for further investigation due to their potential severity and impact.\n\nSatellite imagery from Landsat 8, a joint program between NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, captured images of oil slicks off Louisiana's coast near Port Fourchon. The presence of these slicks suggests that at least three damaged or ruptured submarine pipelines might be the source of the spill. The extent of the oil spill into the Gulf of Mexico, however, remains uncertain.\n\nThe disruption caused by Hurricane Ida to the Gulf of Mexico's oil and gas production was significant. Approximately 90 to 95 percent of the region's production was halted due to the storm. This event serves as a reminder of the vulnerability of the Gulf of Mexico's extensive oil and gas infrastructure to storms.\n\nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) revealed in a 2018 report that 97 percent of pipelines have been left on the seafloor when decommissioned, raising concerns about the potential environmental impact of abandoned infrastructure. With the Gulf of Mexico hosting over 43,000 miles of pipelines, the risks associated with these structures are significant.\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico's seafloor is home to a vast network of oil and gas infrastructure, which is essential to the U.S. energy sector. However, this infrastructure's proximity to the water's surface makes it vulnerable to storms, hurricanes, and other natural disasters. In the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, the focus is on assessing the damage, mitigating the environmental impact, and restoring production as soon as possible.\n\nAs the investigation into the potential pipeline damage caused by Hurricane Ida continues, the importance of preparing for the impact of storms on the Gulf of Mexico's oil and gas infrastructure becomes increasingly apparent. Ongoing efforts to upgrade and maintain these structures, as well as research into more resilient designs and technologies, will be crucial in minimizing the risks and consequences of future storms."}

The prosecution argued that Rittenhouse was in the wrong place at the wrong time, acting out of self-interest rather than self-defense. However, the trial's focus was squarely on the question of whether Rittenhouse acted in self-defense under the law.\n\nAlan Dershowitz, Professor Emeritus at Harvard Law School, believes that \"Rittenhouse's actions, though morally questionable, were protected by the First and Second Amendments. The First Amendment protects his right to bear arms, and the Second Amendment protects his right to use that weapon in self-defense.\" Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the incident, had traveled from his home in Illinois to Kenosha to protect property during the protests.\n\nSome media outlets have portrayed Rittenhouse's tears during his testimony as insincere, but Dershowitz saw them differently. \"His tears were genuine,\" Dershowitz stated. \"They showed that he was scared, and that fear is a valid emotion when one is in a life-threatening situation. It's important to remember that emotions don't negate self-defense claims.\"\n\nThe media commentary on the trial has been anything but unbiased. Dershowitz condemns the biased reporting and emphasizes the importance of live trial coverage for an unbiased understanding of the facts. \"The trial should not be seen as a referendum on broader societal issues, but rather a focus on the specific facts and laws related to the case,\" he said.\n\nThe prosecution made several mistakes during the trial that could have led to a reversed conviction on appeal. For instance, they failed to establish a clear motive for Rittenhouse to shoot the victims, and their witnesses provided conflicting accounts of the events leading up to the shootings. These procedural issues raise serious concerns about the fairness of the trial.\n\nRittenhouse should not be seen as a hero or a symbol of vigilantism. Dershowitz stresses that \"protecting citizens is the job of law enforcement, not individuals taking the law into their own hands.\" The incident in Kenosha was a tragic reminder of the importance of maintaining the rule of law and the role of the criminal justice system in ensuring public safety.\n\nPublic figures who have condemned the verdict, such as former President Barack Obama, have been criticized for politicizing the trial. \"The jury followed the law, and it's important to respect the judicial process,\" Dershowitz stated. \"It's essential to remember that the verdict should be seen as a demonstration of jurors' ability to judge based on evidence and law, not as a support for supremacism or any other ideology.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the Rittenhouse trial was a testament to the rule of law, not a license for vigilantism. The jury's verdict should be respected, and the focus should be on ensuring that similar incidents do not occur in the future.

The narrative presented during the trial, which portrayed Rittenhouse as a beleaguered teenager defending himself against a violent mob, may have resonated with some, but a closer examination of the facts reveals a more complex and troubling story.\n\nJoseph Rosenbaum, the first person Rittenhouse shot, was unarmed but had threatened multiple people and chased Rittenhouse before being shot. Protesters, angered by Rittenhouse's presence with a military-style semiautomatic weapon at a volatile protest, pursued him after the initial shooting. Gaige Grosskreutz, who was armed, was wounded as Rittenhouse attempted to flee the scene. The presence of a weapon at a protest, while legal in Wisconsin, is a recipe for disaster and a dangerous escalation of tensions.\n\nThe legal discussion during Rittenhouse's trial was mired in confusion over a Wisconsin law regarding minors carrying firearms, specifically the exception for long rifles. While Rittenhouse's attorneys argued that the length of the rifle's barrel exempted it from the law, this technicality overlooked the broader issue of a minor wielding a weapon at a protest. The dismissal of the weapon possession charge against Rittenhouse was a narrow victory that did little to address the systemic issues at play.\n\nThe disparities in Rittenhouse's treatment by law enforcement were glaring. Witnesses reported that Rittenhouse was not detained on the spot after the shootings, allowing him to leave the scene and eventually turn himself in. Officers stopped questioning him when they realized he did not understand his Miranda rights, a courtesy often not extended to indigent defendants. These discrepancies in treatment based on appearance underscore the need for a more equitable and fair criminal justice system.\n\nA conviction for Rittenhouse would not address the broader systemic issues within the criminal legal system. The events in Kenosha serve as a stark reminder of the need for meaningful police reform, increased investment in community resources, and a commitment to addressing the root causes of social unrest. Until we acknowledge and address these issues, incidents like the one in Kenosha will continue to occur, perpetuating a cycle of violence and injustice."}

The unusual practice raised eyebrows, as typically, a courtroom clerk would be responsible for drawing jurors' numbers.\n\nJudge Schroeder defended his decision, stating, \"I've been doing this for nearly 20 years, and I've never had anybody complain about it.\" He added, \"The reason I started doing it is to make the defendant feel better about the process.\"\n\nSchroeder explained the origin of the practice, referencing a past trial in Racine, Wisconsin, where he believed letting the defendant make the draw would help maintain control and avoid any potential bad optics. The prosecution and defense attorneys did not object to Schroeder's decision during the Rittenhouse trial.\n\nHowever, the judge criticized those questioning the practice as attempting to undermine the trial's result. Schroeder noted, \"It's not an uncommon practice. It's been going on for a long time. Let's not make a federal case out of it. Let's not try to litigate the trial in the press.\"\n\nRittenhouse pleaded not guilty in the shootings, claiming self-defense. Schroeder also addressed his decision to bar the use of the word 'victims' to describe the men Rittenhouse shot. The judge explained that it was a standard courtroom rule to avoid pre-judging evidence.\n\n\"We don't use the term 'victims' in this courtroom,\" Schroeder stated. \"We call them 'witnesses.' I've been doing this for 51 years, and we've always done it that way.\"\n\nSchroeder's unconventional approach to selecting alternate jurors was met with skepticism from some legal experts. However, the judge remained unapologetic, stating, \"I've never had any complaints about it. I've never had any problems with it.\"\n\nSchroeder's decision to allow Rittenhouse to draw alternate jurors from a raffle tumbler adds another layer of intrigue to the high-profile trial. As the case progresses, the unusual practice is sure to be a topic of discussion among legal experts and the public.\n\nJudge Schroeder summed up his stance on the matter, stating, \"Let's not try to litigate the trial in the press. Let's not make a federal case out of it. Let's just try the case on the facts and the law.\"\n\nThe trial of Kyle Rittenhouse is expected to continue into next week, with both the prosecution and defense presenting their cases. The outcome of the trial will have significant implications for Rittenhouse and the broader debate over self-defense and the use of force during civil unrest.\n\nAs the trial unfolds, Judge Schroeder's decision to allow Rittenhouse to draw alternate jurors from a raffle tumbler will undoubtedly be a topic of discussion. Regardless of the outcome, the practice is likely to continue to be a point of contention among legal experts and the public.\n\nJudge Bruce Schroeder reiterated, \"It's not an uncommon practice. It's been going on for a long time. Let's just try the case on the facts and the law.\""}

The January 6 Capitol attack, spurred by former President Donald Trump, has left Washington on high alert for potential further violence during the inauguration.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray addressed these concerns during a press conference, stating, \"Based on what we've seen over the last couple of months, we're taking it seriously.

We're going to have helmets.\"\n\nThe tension over the transition of power is exacerbated by concerns of insurrectionists posing as security forces.

The storm caused nearly half of Texas's power plants to fail, leaving 4.5 million people without heat or light and leading to several bankruptcies.\n\nThe companies declared force majeure due to their turbines freezing, but allege Citi ignored these declarations and billed them for replacement power at inflated rates. Innergex's lawsuits, filed in Harris County District Court, Houston, Texas, seek to prevent Citi from taking further action and claim that Citi \"improperly defaulted\" them with potential foreclosure on the projects.\n\nCiti billed Shannon Wind $39.5 million and Flat Top Wind $79.3 million for electricity, amounts that exceed their projected annual revenues. Innergex argues that the billed amounts for replacement power were $9,000 per megawatt hour, significantly higher than the contracted rates of roughly $22 to $26 per megawatt hour.\n\nCiti argues that contract disputes should be resolved in New York courts under New York law, questioning the legitimacy of filing the cases in Texas. BlackRock Inc, a part-owner of one of the wind firms, declined to comment, while Starwood Energy Group and Innergex have not responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe winter storm, which hit Texas in February, caused widespread power outages and exposed vulnerabilities in the state's power grid. The storm also led to a surge in natural gas prices, driving up the cost of electricity for power companies.\n\nInnergex's lawsuits come as the renewable energy industry faces increasing scrutiny over the reliability of wind and solar power during extreme weather events. Critics argue that renewable energy sources are not yet able to provide consistent power during periods of high demand, while supporters point to advancements in energy storage technology.\n\nThe lawsuits could set a precedent for how power companies and financial institutions handle disputes related to extreme weather events and force majeure declarations. Innergex's legal team argues that the company acted in accordance with its contracts and that Citi's actions were in breach of those agreements.\n\nThe case is Innergex Renewable Energy Inc et al v Citigroup Global Markets Inc et al, Harris County District Court, Houston, Texas, No. 2021-03363 and 2021-03364."}

Among them were two former high-ranking political figures, Colin Powell and Donald Rumsfeld, whose legacies were significantly shaped by their involvement in the war in Iraq.\n\nColin Powell, a four-star general and former Secretary of State, died on October 18, 2021, at the age of 84. Powell was the first African American to hold the positions of National Security Advisor and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. His tenure as Secretary of State from 2001 to 2005 saw him advocate for military intervention in Iraq, citing evidence of weapons of mass destruction that later proved to be false.\n\nDonald Rumsfeld, who served as the United States Secretary of Defense from 1969 to 1975 and again from 2001 to 2006, passed away on June 29, 2021, at the age of 88. Like Powell, Rumsfeld's tenure in office was marked by his role in the Iraq War. Known for his controversial management style, Rumsfeld was criticized for his handling of the war and the mistreatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib.\n\nBeyond the political sphere, other notable figures who left us in 2021 included Walter F. Mondale, the 43rd Vice President of the United States, and F.W. de Klerk, the former President of South Africa, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela in 1993. In the world of sports, baseball legend Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's home run record in 1974 and passed away in January at the age of 86.\n\nThe sports community also mourned the loss of Tommy Lasorda, the iconic manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers who led the team to two World Series titles, and Bobby Bowden, the winningest coach in college football history, who passed away in August at the age of 91.\n\nChildren's author Beverly Cleary, known for creating beloved characters like Ramona Quimby and Henry Huggins, died in March at the age of 104. Entertainers who left us in 2021 included Cicely Tyson, a pioneering actress and civil rights activist, Ed Asner, a prolific actor best known for his role as Lou Grant, and Christopher Plummer, a versatile actor who won two Academy Awards.\n\nThe world of music lost several notable figures in 2021. Drummer Charlie Watts, a founding member of the Rolling Stones, passed away in August at the age of 80. Rapper DMX, known for hits like \"Party Up (Up in Here)\" and \"X Gon' Give It to Ya,\" died in April at the age of 50. Biz Markie, a pioneering hip-hop artist, died in July at the age of 57.\n\nIn the realm of arts, the world mourned the loss of Stephen Sondheim, a legendary composer and lyricist who revolutionized American musical theater. Carla Fracci, a renowned Italian ballerina, and Richard Donner, a prolific film and television director, also passed away in 2021.\n\nAs we reflect on the lives and legacies of these individuals, it is essential to remember the indelible impact they had on their respective fields and the world at large.

Hogan's remarkable return to golf after a near-fatal car accident in 1949, where he went on to win an astounding seven major championships, has left an indelible mark on the sport's history.\n\nFast-forward to April 2019, Woods stood atop the Masters leaderboard, holding the coveted green jacket aloft, marking a significant comeback for the golfing icon. Having endured years of injuries and setbacks, Woods' triumph at Augusta National Golf Club was reminiscent of Hogan's gritty determination in the face of adversity.\n\nBen Hogan, born in 1912, is considered one of the greatest golfers of all time. His golfing prowess was unparalleled, with an impressive record of fifteen major championships under his belt. However, it was his comeback from the devastating car accident in 1949 that cemented his place in golf folklore.\n\nThe accident, a head-on collision, left Hogan with multiple fractures and injuries, including a broken collarbone, ribs, and blood clots in his lungs. The odds of a full recovery were slim, but Hogan's indomitable spirit and unyielding willpower paved the way for his miraculous comeback.\n\nIn stark contrast to Hogan's recovery, Woods, who sustained injuries from a car accident in California in February 2021, enjoys significant financial security and access to advanced medical and rehabilitation resources. While Hogan relied on his personal resilience and determination, Woods has the luxury of world-class care and support to aid his recovery.\n\nDespite these advantages, Woods' comeback is still a testament to the human spirit and the will to overcome adversity. The parallels drawn between the two golfing legends extend beyond their remarkable recoveries; both dominated the sport during their prime and left an indelible mark on golf history.\n\nHogan's comeback was marked by numerous physical challenges and a lack of modern medical support. Despite these obstacles, he persevered and went on to win the U.S. Open at Merion Golf Club in 1950, just one year after the accident. Hogan's legacy extends beyond his major championship victories; he also established a successful golf club company, Ben Hogan Golf Equipment Company.\n\nIn recognition of Woods' inspiring comeback, the Golf Writers Association of America awarded him the Ben Hogan Award in 2019. The award is given annually to an active golfer who has overcome significant physical hardships to achieve success. Woods' journey from injury to victory serves as a testament to his resilience and determination, making him a worthy recipient of this esteemed accolade."}

Around 12% of global trade passes through this crucial link, and the incident could exacerbate the economic impact of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nOpeoluwa Dapo-Thomas, a private oil market trader, noted, \"The Suez Canal is a significant maritime route for global trade, especially for crude oil transportation. Its disruption could potentially lead to increased costs for ship owners and insurance companies.\"\n\nThe Ever Given's grounding resulted in a massive traffic jam of more than 400 ships waiting to pass through the canal. To free the vessel, efforts included removing 27,000 cubic meters of sand from around its hull. Despite the ship being partially refloated, normal traffic in the Suez Canal has yet to resume, causing potential demurrage and insurance claims.\n\nVice President and Head of Trade & Marine Operations at Gladius Commodities Limited, Okojie Larry, commented, \"The blockage could take days or weeks to clear, which could lead to significant freight cost increases. These costs will eventually be passed on to consumers, potentially resulting in price hikes for various goods in Nigeria.\"\n\nNigeria, being an import-dependent economy, risks facing increased prices for goods due to shipping delays. In 2020, the country imported over $21 billion worth of goods, including crude oil, refined petroleum, and food items. The Suez Canal blockage could lead to significant delays in the transportation of these goods, impacting market liquidity.\n\nAccording to Okojie Larry, some of the goods that could see price increases include wheat, rice, sugar, and edible oils.

Furthermore, the country is rich in natural resources, which can help mitigate the impact of potential price hikes for imported goods.\"\n\nHowever, Dapo-Thomas also acknowledged the increased costs for ship owners and insurance companies due to the blockage. He stated, \"Shippers are already incurring additional costs due to the delay in the Suez Canal's reopening, which could lead to increased insurance premiums and higher freight rates.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the Suez Canal blockage could lead to significant price hikes for various goods in Nigeria due to increased transportation costs and potential supply shortages. Efforts to free the vessel and reopen the canal are ongoing, but it could take days or even weeks before normal traffic resumes. In the meantime, Nigerian businesses are incurring demurrages, which could impact market liquidity. The long-term implications of this disruption remain to be seen, but it is clear that the global economy will feel the ripple effects for some time.\n\nOkojie Larry emphasized, \"The Suez Canal is a crucial link for global trade, and its disruption could lead to significant price hikes for various goods in Nigeria. Businesses and consumers need to be prepared for potential increases in the prices of imported commodities.\"\n\nDapo-Thomas added, \"While the impact on Nigeria may be relatively small, the disruption to global trade could lead to increased costs for ship owners and insurance companies. These costs will eventually be passed on to consumers, potentially leading to price hikes for various goods and services.\""}

I address you not only as the President of the United States but also as a fellow American, deeply grieved by the senseless acts of violence that have claimed the lives of our brave service members and innocent civilians at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul.\n\nISIS-K, a terrorist organization, has taken responsibility for this cowardly attack. They sought to undermine our efforts to evacuate American citizens and Afghan allies from Afghanistan. But they failed. They have only strengthened our resolve to complete this mission and bring those responsible to justice.\n\nI have been in constant contact with our military commanders on the ground. The situation is still evolving, and our brave men and women in uniform are working tirelessly to secure the airport and continue the evacuation process. Our thoughts and prayers are with them as they carry out this critical mission.\n\nAs we face this adversity, we must remember the fallen heroes who gave their lives in the line of duty. They were part of a significant and noble effort to save countless lives and bring hope to a troubled region. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten.\n\nOver the last 11 days, more than 100,000 individuals have been safely evacuated from Afghanistan. This is a testament to the resilience and determination of our military, diplomatic corps, and international partners. We will continue this mission, come what may.\n\nI want to express my deepest condolences to the families of the fallen service members and civilians. Your loved ones will always be remembered as heroes, not only to their families but to the entire nation. Their legacy will live on in the hearts and minds of the American people.\n\nAs we grieve, we also remain steadfast in our commitment to bring those responsible for this heinous attack to justice. We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I have ordered the development of operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership, and facilities. Our resolve is unwavering.\n\nThe mission to evacuate American citizens and Afghan allies will continue, regardless of the challenges we face. This is not just a matter of national security; it is a moral imperative. We cannot abandon those who have put their trust in us, those who have stood by our side in the face of adversity.\n\nI call on all Americans to join me in a moment of silence for those who have given their lives in service to our great nation. Let us remember their sacrifices and honor their memory.\n\nWe will face more challenges in the days and weeks to come. But we will not be deterred. We will remain steadfast in our commitment to peace, security, and freedom. We will continue to work with our allies and partners to promote stability and prosperity around the world.\n\nLet us come together as a nation, united in our resolve to complete this mission and honor the sacrifices of those who have given their lives in its pursuit. Together, we will overcome this tragedy and continue to be a beacon of hope and freedom for all.\n\nIn closing, I want to express my gratitude to our military personnel, diplomats, and international partners for their tireless efforts in this critical mission. Your courage and dedication are an inspiration to us all. May God bless you and keep you safe. May God bless the families of the fallen. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.\n\nWe will not be broken. We will not be defeated. We will continue to stand tall in the face of adversity, united in our resolve to protect our nation and promote peace and freedom around the world. Together, we will persevere. Together, we will overcome. Together, we will honor the sacrifices of those who have given their lives in service to our great nation.\n\nGod bless you all, and God bless America."}

Some areas of the city have not seen collection services since the storm. The delay is attributed to labor issues and the national labor shortage.\n\nMayor LaToya Cantrell announced on September 14, 2021, that residents could dispose of their trash at the Elysian Fields Transfer Station, starting from September 16, 2021. This temporary measure came in response to the city's ongoing struggle with collecting and disposing of post-hurricane waste.\n\nMetro Service Group, the city's trash collection agency, had been lagging in collections even before Hurricane Ida struck. In May 2020, workers for the agency went on strike, demanding higher wages and COVID-19 protection equipment.\n\n\"We're trying to do our part, but it's hard when we're not getting paid a living wage,\" said Ryan Nelsen, a striking worker for Metro Service Group. \"We want to help our community, but we also need to take care of ourselves and our families.\"\n\nTo address staffing challenges, the city contracted additional waste companies and extended existing contracts to find more bidders. Yet, the delays have left residents frustrated, with some taking personal steps to manage and dispose of their trash.\n\nJesse Webber, a resident of the Lower Ninth Ward, shared his experience, \"We've been piling up our trash for weeks now. It's unsanitary and it's starting to attract vermin. I can't believe this is still going on.\"\n\nThe labor dispute from the previous year is remembered, highlighting ongoing issues with fair compensation for trash collectors. The situation is especially pressing in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, where the city's waste management system is under increased pressure.\n\nA 'Trash Parade' protest has been scheduled for September 18, 2021, to bring attention to the issue. Meanwhile, City Council members are seeking solutions through a joint Public Works and Budget Committees meeting.\n\nMayor Cantrell's pre-Ida claim of emergency preparedness has come under scrutiny amid the current trash collection delays. Residents question why the city was not better prepared to manage post-hurricane waste.\n\n\"I've lived through several hurricanes, and I've never seen our trash situation this bad,\" said Councilmember Jared Brossett. \"We need to find long-term solutions to address the underlying issues, such as fair wages and adequate staffing.\"\n\nCouncilmember Helena Moreno agreed, stating, \"We cannot continue to rely on piecemeal solutions. We need a comprehensive plan to ensure our city's waste management system is resilient and can withstand future storms and challenges.\"\n\nThe city's waste management crisis is a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges New Orleans faces in its post-hurricane recovery. With the national labor shortage and local labor disputes, the road to recovery may be longer than anticipated.\n\nAs residents continue to grapple with the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, they are left wondering when their trash will be collected and when a sense of normalcy will return to their neighborhoods. In the meantime, they remain hopeful that the city will find solutions to address the underlying issues and bring about much-needed relief."}

In a conference call with the media, the coach shed light on the intricacies of the roster-building process.\n\n\"We're excited about the group we've put together,\" Arians stated. \"We kept ten new guys, which is fewer than we'd like, but we have a lot of depth and competition at most positions.\"\n\nThe Buccaneers' roster includes just ten newcomers: six draft picks, three undrafted rookies, and one veteran free agent. Surprisingly, Coach Arians opted for ten linebackers and only six defensive backs.\n\nArians shared his thoughts on the linebacker-heavy roster: \"We had a lot of competition at the linebacker position. I think it's going to benefit us greatly. We've got some young guys who can develop quickly.\"\n\nAmong the six draft picks, five made the roster: second-round pick K.J. Britt (inside linebacker), third-round pick Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (outside linebacker), fourth-round pick K.J. Hill (wide receiver), and fifth-round picks Robert Hainsey (offensive guard) and Jamar Summers (cornerback). Seventh-round cornerback Chris Wilcox was not included.\n\nJose Borregales, the undrafted rookie kicker, made the team, while Ryan Succop is expected to return from the COVID list.\n\n\"Jose had a great camp,\" Arians acknowledged. \"He's a great kid and a great competitor. He's earned the right to be our kicker. But, we'll welcome Ryan back whenever he's ready.\"\n\nNotable holdovers on the roster include Tom Brady at quarterback, Giovani Bernard and Leonard Fournette at running back, Antonio Brown at wide receiver, and Rob Gronkowski, Cameron Brate, and O.J. Howard at tight end. Brate and Howard are coming off injuries.\n\nArians addressed the tight end position, stating, \"Cameron, Rob, and O.J. form a formidable trio. They all bring something unique to the table. We're excited about what they can do.\"\n\nDefensive lineman Ndamukong Suh, activated from the COVID list, is expected to expand the defensive line. Outside linebacker Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, a first-round pick, deepens the edge rotation.\n\nRookie quarterback Kyle Trask was retained as a potential successor to Tom Brady. Arians added, \"Kyle is a smart kid. He's got a strong arm and can make all the throws. He's going to learn a lot from Tom.\"\n\nArians emphasized the importance of competition throughout the roster: \"We'll always have competition at every position. It keeps everyone on their toes and helps us improve as a team.\"\n\nThe Buccaneers are poised for another successful season, with a roster that blends veteran leadership and promising newcomers under the guidance of Coach Bruce Arians."}

The lawsuit, which accuses Remington of reckless marketing of the weapon to civilians, has taken an unexpected turn as Remington's lawyers have subpoenaed academic records for five slain students and employment files for educators involved in the case.\n\nJoshua Koskoff, the lead attorney for the families, expressed his disappointment and concern over Remington's request for confidential records. \"Remington's attempt to invade the privacy of these young victims and their families is not only irrelevant to the case at hand, but it is also an affront to the memory of those we have lost,\" Koskoff stated.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by GPB News, Remington's lawyers have also demanded access to the employment files of educators who have spoken publicly about the shooting and its aftermath. This request has raised eyebrows among legal experts, who view it as an attempt to discredit potential witnesses.\n\nIn response, Koskoff asked the court to seal the students' academic records, arguing that their release would constitute a violation of their privacy and an unwarranted intrusion into their lives. \"These records have nothing to do with the facts of this case or Remington's liability for the harm it caused,\" Koskoff emphasized.\n\nRemington Arms, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2018 and again in 2019, has yet to comment on the matter.

If accepted, the settlement would bring an end to the long-standing litigation.\n\n\"We will continue to fight for justice and accountability on behalf of our clients and the memory of their loved ones,\" Koskoff pledged. \"The release of these sensitive records will not deter us from seeking the truth and holding Remington accountable for its role in this tragedy.\""}

Trump: A Business Magnate Turned Politician - From Real Estate Tycoon to Controversial President\n\nBorn on June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York, Donald J. Trump entered the world as the fourth child of Frederick C. and Mary McLeod Trump. Trump's journey from a privileged upbringing to becoming a business magnate and ultimately, the 45th President of the United States, is a testament to his relentless ambition and controversial style.\n\nIn 1971, at the age of 25, Trump took over his father's real estate company, Elizabeth Trump & Son, and transformed it into a global business empire. His ventures expanded beyond real estate into sectors such as construction, hospitality, and entertainment.\n\nTrump's literary accomplishments include the best-selling business book, \"The Art of the Deal,\" published in 1987, and his reality TV show, \"The Apprentice,\" which aired from 2004 to 2015. The show, known for Trump's signature catchphrase, \"You're fired,\" brought him further into the public eye.\n\nThe 2016 Presidential Election marked a significant turning point in Trump's career. Defying the odds, he defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with a majority of Electoral College votes, securing his place in history.\n\nTrump's presidency brought about significant policy changes, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, trade tariffs to protect American industries, and the appointment of conservative judges to the federal bench. One of his most notable actions was moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem in May 2018.\n\nIn late 2018, a partial government shutdown occurred due to disagreements between Trump and Congress over funding for a border wall.

With the third round of $1,400 checks having been distributed in March 2021, many Americans are looking for further financial assistance.\n\nStephanie Bonin, a resident of Massachusetts, has taken matters into her own hands by starting a petition on Change.org advocating for $2,000 monthly recurring payments for every American adult. As of now, the petition has nearly reached its 3 million signature goal.\n\nProgressive lawmakers, including Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have petitioned the White House for recurring payments or additional stimulus money. Sanders introduced the \"Monthly Economic Crisis Support Act,\" which aims to provide $2,000 per month to every American adult until the economy recovers.\n\nSome states have taken matters into their own hands by implementing state-specific stimulus checks and teacher bonuses. California, for example, has approved $600 stimulus checks for residents earning under $30,000 per year. Multiple states, including Arizona, Colorado, and Oklahoma, have announced $1,000 bonuses for teachers.\n\nThe Child Tax Credit, which was expanded as part of the American Rescue Plan, provides up to $3,600 per child under 6 and $3,000 for children 6-17. Monthly payments of up to $300 per child began on July 15 and will continue until December 2021.\n\nAdditionally, Plus-Up Payments are available for those whose 2020 income was lower than their 2019 income, potentially qualifying them for additional stimulus money.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan also includes the Homeowners Assistance Fund (HAF), which aims to help homeowners with mortgage payments and utility bills. At least $50 million has been allocated for each state and territory.\n\nThe extension of the CDC's national eviction ban offers two more months of protection for renters, with $46.6 billion allocated for emergency rental assistance.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is advocating for significant investment in infrastructure through the American Jobs Plan. The plan aims to rebuild roads, bridges, and public transportation systems, as well as invest in clean energy and broadband internet.\n\nThe American Families Plan, while not detailed in the summary, is part of Biden's Build Back Better Plan. This plan aims to expand access to affordable child care, provide free universal preschool, and make community college tuition-free.\n\nPresident Biden's American Jobs Plan is a $2.3 trillion investment in infrastructure and jobs. The proposal includes funding for roads, bridges, public transportation, broadband internet, clean energy, and electric vehicle charging stations.\n\nThe American Jobs Plan also includes funding for schools and universities, as well as money for research and development in fields such as advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe American Jobs Plan is expected to create millions of jobs, with a focus on employment opportunities for disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan, which was signed into law in March 2021, provided $1.9 trillion in relief for individuals, small businesses, and state and local governments.\n\nThe Child Tax Credit expansion is expected to lift 4.1 million children out of poverty, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThe Homeowners Assistance Fund (HAF) is expected to help millions of homeowners avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan also includes funding for vaccine distribution and testing, as well as money for mental health services and substance abuse treatment.\n\nThe extension of the national eviction ban is expected to help prevent a wave of evictions, which could lead to a surge in homelessness and further strain the healthcare system.\n\nThe American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan are expected to be paid for through a combination of tax increases on corporations and high-income individuals, as well as closing tax loopholes.\n\nThe passage of the American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan remains uncertain, as they will need to be approved by Congress. However, President Biden has expressed optimism that they can be passed with bipartisan support."}

While the first impeachment trial was marked by intricate evidence and testimony, the second was more visceral, focusing on the violence that unfolded on January 6, 2021.\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, in a statement following the second impeachment, criticized Trump's actions but ultimately voted to acquit on constitutional grounds. \"There is no question – none – that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,\" McConnell said. \"But the Constitution confronts us with even more difficult questions: What are the appropriate remedies for such conduct? What should the Congress do in the 13 days remaining before President-elect Biden is sworn in?\"\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), the Democratic majority leader, expressed disappointment with the outcome of the second trial. \"Senate Republicans have chosen to turn a blind eye to the facts, to the rule of law, and to the threat to our democracy,\" Schumer stated. \"Donald Trump incited an insurrection against the United States Government. The evidence was clear. The facts were undeniable.\"\n\nThe first impeachment, which occurred in late 2019, centered around a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump asked for an investigation into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The second impeachment trial, however, was more focused on Trump's rhetoric and encouragement of his supporters before and during the Capitol riot.\n\nTrump's influence on his followers was likened to his previous boast about shooting someone and still retaining support. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), who voted to convict Trump during the first trial, emphasized the significance of Trump's actions leading up to the Capitol riot. \"The evidence is compelling that President Trump is guilty of incitement of insurrection,\" Romney stated during the trial.\n\nDespite the events of January 6 and subsequent impeachment, Trump maintained significant loyalty among Congressional supporters. In a statement, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) defended Trump, stating, \"President Trump did nothing wrong. He had every right to call on his supporters to come to Washington, D.C. to support him and to protest peacefully.\"\n\nThe impeachment trial took place without Trump's presence; he refrained from making public comments during the proceedings. In a statement released after the acquittal, Trump said, \"It is a sad day and disappointment for so many, but I always knew this result would end in a Senate find-not-guilty verdict, and now I have been vindicated. No president has ever gone through anything like this.\"\n\nThe second impeachment trial allowed senators, as eyewitnesses to the January 6 events, an unprecedented perspective. While the outcome did not result in a conviction, the trial served as a reminder of the events that unfolded on that fateful day and the divisive political climate that continues to shape American politics.\n\nIn the end, Trump was acquitted in his second impeachment trial with a 57-43 vote, not reaching the required 67 votes for conviction. As the United States moves forward, the impact of these historic impeachments and their outcomes will continue to shape the political landscape and the legacy of the 45th President of the United States."}

Harris acknowledged concerns over job losses in the coal, oil, and gas industries but suggested retraining for workers towards reclaiming abandoned land mines and plugging oil and gas leaks. \"We're focused on creating jobs while addressing climate change,\" she explained. \"We're not going to be negatively impacting existing leases.\"\n\nSenator Shelley Moore-Capito (R-W.Va.) recently introduced legislation opposing President Biden's executive orders on energy, known as the Protecting Our Communities and Engaging Responsibly (POWER) Act. In response to the POWER Act, Harris stated, \"We'll work with Congress, and we'll see what they bring to the table. Our focus is on creating jobs, investing in clean energy, and addressing climate change.\"\n\nConcerns were raised about vaccine distribution based on state population, especially for states like West Virginia with efficient vaccination but small size. Vice President Harris addressed this issue, stating, \"We're working to vaccinate everyone, and we have an initial goal of 100 million vaccinations in our first 100 days. West Virginia is doing well, and we're committed to continuing that progress.\"\n\nAdditionally, the ARP aims to address child poverty, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and resulting unemployment. Harris called for unity, stating that though the administration is Democratic, they serve all Americans regardless of political affiliation. \"We're here to serve the American people, and we're going to do that regardless of political affiliation,\" she said. \"We're in this together, and we're going to get through this together.\""}

All 254 counties in Texas were under a winter storm warning as of Tuesday, with freezing temperatures expected to last through the week.\n\n\"When refineries are offline, it reduces the overall supply of gasoline,\" DeHaan explained. \"That's going to cause prices to go up as a result.\"\n\nEleven refineries in Texas and one in Kansas have partially shut down due to the extreme weather, exacerbating the supply crunch. Meanwhile, the gradual lifting of COVID-19 travel restrictions has already driven up gas prices due to rising demand.\n\n\"As more people get vaccinated and travel restrictions ease, we're starting to see a surge in demand for gasoline,\" DeHaan noted. \"That's putting additional pressure on prices.\"\n\nCurrently, the average price of gas in Illinois stands at $2.77 per gallon, up from $2.48 last year. The annual switch to summer-blend gasoline, which begins in March, is also contributing to the price hike.\n\n\"Gas prices in Rockford could reach an average of $3 per gallon by Memorial Day,\" DeHaan predicted. \"It may take refineries up to two weeks to return to full service after the cold snap.\"\n\nAccording to DeHaan, gasoline demand and prices may continue to rise into March and April as travel picks up and refineries work to meet the heightened demand.\n\n\"The good news is that once refineries are back online, we should start to see prices ease,\" DeHaan said. \"But in the short term, it's going to be a challenging situation for consumers.\""}

Wallace, the only full-time Black driver in the NASCAR Cup Series, voiced his belief that Rittenhouse would have been treated more harshly if he were Black, stating, \"If he was an African American, he probably would have received the death penalty or life in prison.\"\n\nRittenhouse, then 17 years old, claimed self-defense in the shooting that occurred on August 25, 2020, during protests over the police shooting of Jacob Blake. The protests turned violent, leading to widespread unrest and looting in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Rittenhouse's acquittal, announced on November 19, 2021, has further deepened the partisan divide in the country.\n\nKaren Bloom and John Huber, parents of Anthony Huber, one of the victims, expressed their disappointment in the verdict, stating, \"There's no accountability for taking our son's life, and that's very disturbing.\" Huber was shot and killed during an altercation with Rittenhouse. The trial outcome has left many questioning the fairness of the justice system and sparked discussions about racial injustice.\n\nSenator Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) commented on the verdict, stating, \"I think it's a fair verdict. I think it's a just verdict. I think Kyle Rittenhouse acted in self-defense.\" Johnson's stance aligns with those who view the verdict as justice served, while others, including Wallace, see it as a miscarriage of justice.\n\nThe trial and its outcome have sparked heated debates across the country. Some argue that Rittenhouse acted in self-defense, while others maintain that he instigated the violence and should have been held accountable for his actions. \"The system failed us,\" Wallace tweeted. \"At the end of the day, it's just another example of how the justice system isn't equal for everyone.\"\n\nConcerns about violent protests following the verdict have prompted increased security measures in Kenosha and other cities.

This position, grounded in our commitment to the rule of law and constitutional norms, does not in any way infringe upon the First Amendment rights of the President or any American.\n\nIn a historic move, the ACLU Board of Directors unanimously passed a resolution on January 13, 2021, calling for the impeachment of President Trump. This decision was not made lightly. We recognize the gravity of invoking this political remedy, but we cannot stand idly by as our nation's democratic institutions are imperiled. The President's efforts to subvert the results of a free and fair election represent a clear and present danger to our constitutional order.\n\nPresident Trump's actions, including his incendiary speech on January 6, are not isolated incidents. They are part of a pattern of behavior that undermines the very fabric of our democracy. Impeachment is not a criminal proceeding; it is a political process aimed at removing an executive official for abusing the power of their office.\n\nIt is essential to clarify that the First Amendment does not shield public officials, including the President, from sanctions related to speech in their official capacity. The landmark Supreme Court case of Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969) established that \"the constitutional guarantees of speech and press do not permit a State to forbid advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed at inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\" President Trump's speech on January 6, 2021, meets none of these criteria.\n\nThe ACLU's unwavering commitment to the First Amendment is a cornerstone of our mission. We have defended the free speech rights of the unpopular and the marginalized, knowing that a vibrant democracy thrives on the exchange of ideas, even those that may be offensive or distasteful. Impeachment is not an affront to the First Amendment; it is an affirmation of our commitment to upholding the Constitution and the principles it embodies.\n\nWe stand at a pivotal moment in our nation's history, grappling with complex issues of race, rights, and freedoms. This tumultuous period has sparked beneficial debates and a burgeoning resistance movement focused on social justice and constitutional norms.

The creators behind the scenes, including Peters and series director Craig Zobel, had a clear intention: to evoke a strong emotional response from the audience with Zabel's demise.\n\n\"Colin Zabel's death was always part of the plan,\" Zobel shared in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. \"We wanted it to be a pivotal moment in the series, and we hoped it would surprise and move viewers.\"\n\nPeters, who delved into the complexities of his character up until his last day of shooting, echoed Zobel's sentiments. \"Playing Colin Zabel was a challenging and rewarding experience,\" Peters said in an episode of the podcast Still Watching: Mare of Easttown. \"His death was a turning point not just for the story, but for me as an actor.\"\n\nAt the beginning of the series, series creator Brad Ingelsby envisioned Colin Zabel as a confident, somewhat cocky detective. However, as filming progressed, the character's portrayal shifted from a self-assured investigator to an earnest young man grappling with imposter syndrome.\n\nMeghan Kasperlik, the show's costume designer, visually reflected this transformation through Zabel's wardrobe. \"Initially, we dressed Colin in tailored suits and crisp shirts to emphasize his confidence,\" Kasperlik explained. \"But as his character evolved, we began to introduce more casual, less polished pieces to reflect his growing insecurities.\"\n\nIngelsby expanded on Zabel's character development, sharing that Colin's backstory included taking credit for a case he didn't solve, intensifying his internal struggles. \"It was important to show that even the most confident characters can have vulnerabilities and doubts,\" Ingelsby said.\n\nPeters related more to the character's insecurity and imposter syndrome than to the initial concept of overconfidence. \"I've had my own moments of feeling like I don't belong or that I'm not good enough,\" Peters shared in the podcast interview. \"Playing Colin allowed me to explore those feelings in a new way.\"\n\nDespite the emotional depth of the role, one aspect of Zabel's character didn't make it to the screen: his pool skills.

Social media users suggest that if one can be hacked, so can the other. However, a fact check reveals these claims are misleading.\n\nOn May 7, 2021, the Colonial Pipeline was hit by a ransomware attack, affecting its IT systems and halting operations. Kevin Feeney, a spokesperson for Colonial Pipeline, stated, \"We took certain systems offline to contain the threat, which temporarily halted all pipeline operations. We engaged a leading, third-party cybersecurity firm to help us understand the nature of what happened.\"\n\nIn contrast, investigations have found no evidence of interference in the November 2020 election. Will Adler, a senior technologist for elections and democracy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, commented, \"The comparison between the Colonial Pipeline hack and election fraud claims is misleading. U.S. voting systems are not vulnerable on a large scale.\"\n\nRansomware attacks, like the one on Colonial Pipeline, encrypt data to extort ransom. They often target corporations and hospitals. The FBI identified software from the cybercrime group DarkSide as responsible for the Colonial Pipeline attack.\n\nFeeney further highlighted Colonial Pipeline's stringent IT and operational technology segmentation policies, stating, \"Our IT systems are separate from our operational technology systems. The operational technology network that runs our pipelines is not connected to our corporate IT network. We have strict access controls for our operational technology network, and this attack did not impact our ability to safely operate, maintain the pipeline, or process transactions.\"\n\nPosts connecting the pipeline hack to voting machine vulnerabilities build on baseless 2020 election fraud claims. However, the decentralized nature of U.S. elections and their security measures prevent such cyberattacks from impacting election outcomes.\n\nDominion Voting Systems and other authorities have consistently refuted claims of election infrastructure hacking in the 2020 election. In a statement, Dominion Voting Systems said, \"There is no credible evidence to support these claims. Dominion systems were not involved in any way in the transfer of votes from one candidate to another, nor was any vote count or election result altered or manipulated.\"\n\nAdler reiterated, \"There is no evidence to suggest that U.S. voting systems were targeted or compromised in a way that could have changed the outcome of the 2020 election. It's important to separate these two issues, as they are fundamentally different.\"\n\nColonial Pipeline's Feeney added, \"Our focus right now is on restoring full pipeline operations and making our system more secure for the future. It's crucial that we don't conflate these two distinct issues.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the Colonial Pipeline hack and election fraud claims are two unrelated matters. While the pipeline was affected by a ransomware attack, U.S. voting systems remain secure and resilient. As Adler stated, \"The comparison between the two is misleading, and it's essential to maintain an accurate understanding of each issue.\""}

Rod West, Entergy's group president of utility operations, said the utility had made significant investments to improve the transmission system.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, Entergy spent about $1.2 billion on transmission system improvements. But the effectiveness of these upgrades against Hurricane Ida is being questioned.\n\n\"There are always going to be criticisms after an event like this,\" West said during a media briefing on Sept. 1. \"But I think if you look at the investments that we've made, we've made significant investments in our transmission system.\"\n\nEntergy's transmission network consists of infrastructure with varying wind resistance ratings, resulting in a mix of old and new standards. About one-sixth of Entergy Louisiana's transmission system can only withstand wind speeds of up to 95 mph, according to Michelle Bourg, vice president of communications for Entergy.\n\nPhillip May, chief executive of Entergy Louisiana LLC, requested regulator approval for over $500 million to repair and rebuild transmission lines damaged in 2020 hurricanes.\n\nPraveen Malhotra, an engineer and expert on catastrophe risk, said utilities like Entergy need to invest heavily to modernize and fortify infrastructure against more frequent severe weather events.\n\n\"When you look at the costs of not investing, it's massive,\" Malhotra said. \"It's not just about the storm damage itself, but also the economic and social disruption.\"\n\nRecent storms, including Hurricane Laura in 2020 and Ida, have focused damage on Entergy's older infrastructure, while newer structures have largely withstood the impacts.\n\nLogan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, said Entergy should have done more to protect its infrastructure.\n\n\"Entergy should have known that these storms were coming,\" Burke said. \"They should have been more proactive in hardening their infrastructure.\"\n\nEntergy is investing in local generation capacity to address transmission constraints due to New Orleans' geographic limitations. Eric Smith, associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute, said this approach could be more resilient in the long run.\n\n\"Distributed generation, like rooftop solar and community microgrids, can help reduce the reliance on the transmission system and make the grid more resilient,\" Smith said.\n\nExperts predict U.S. utilities will need to invest $500 billion to modernize and fortify infrastructure against more frequent severe weather events, according to a report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.\n\nWest defended the company's efforts in building a resilient system, saying Entergy had made significant investments in vegetation management, transmission line inspections, and upgrading substations.\n\n\"We've made significant investments in our vegetation management program, our transmission line inspections, and our substation upgrades,\" West said. \"We're continually looking at ways to make our system more resilient and better prepared for extreme weather events.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Entergy is working to restore power to its customers as quickly and safely as possible. The utility aims to have power restored to 90% of its customers by the end of September.\n\n\"Our team is working around the clock to restore power to our customers as safely and efficiently as possible,\" West said. \"We understand the importance of having electricity during these difficult times, and we're doing everything we can to get the power back on as quickly as possible.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Hurricane Ida's devastating winds left over 1 million Entergy customers without power, prompting scrutiny over the utility's preparedness and the resilience of the electric system. Entergy spent over $1.2 billion on transmission system improvements from 2017 to 2019, but the effectiveness of these upgrades against Ida is being questioned. Experts predict U.S. utilities will need to invest $500 billion to modernize and fortify infrastructure against more frequent severe weather events. Entergy is investing in local generation capacity and working to restore power to its customers as safely and efficiently as possible."}

The accident left Woods with broken bones in his right leg and facial injuries, but no head injuries were reported.\n\nInitially, Sheriff Alex Villanueva of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department declared the crash an \"accident,\" stating there was no evidence of impairment. However, the absence of a drug-recognition expert (DRE) evaluation at the scene has raised eyebrows among experts.\n\nQuote from Alex Villanueva: \"There was no evidence of impairment at the scene or at the hospital. So, we don't have a DRE evaluation.\"\n\nCharles Schack, President of Crash Experts, an investigative firm, commented on the importance of a DRE assessment in such cases: \"A DRE evaluation is crucial to determine if there were any drugs or alcohol involved. It's a 12-step process that includes questioning about medications, examining vital signs, and other assessments.\"\n\nAccording to Sheriff's Deputy John Schloegl, who was the first responder at the scene, Woods was lucid and showed no signs of impairment. However, Woods later reported memory loss regarding the incident.\n\nQuote from John Schloegl: \"Mr. Woods was oriented to person, place, and time. He was lucid, he was coherent, and he was not showing any signs of impairment.\"\n\nJonathan Cherney, an accident reconstructionist, analyzed the crash characteristics and suggested they resembled those of a person falling asleep at the wheel. \"The vehicle was traveling at a high rate of speed, veered off the road, and struck a tree. The absence of braking or steering away from the crash path is concerning,\" he stated.\n\nExperts argue that the lack of braking evidence and Woods' memory loss could indicate impairment, warranting a DRE assessment. Chris Taylor, Managing Attorney at Taylor & Taylor, emphasized the significance of a thorough investigation: \"It's essential to have a complete and accurate picture of what happened to ensure justice and accountability.\"\n\nQuote from Chris Taylor: \"The lack of a DRE assessment and blood evidence means it's now too late to obtain Woods' hospital blood and medical reports without his cooperation or a search warrant.\"\n\nVillanueva defended his decision not to use a DRE by citing Woods' lucid demeanor and the absence of signs of impairment at the scene. \"Mr. Woods was coherent, he was oriented, he was aware of where he was, and he wasn't showing any signs of intoxication,\" Villanueva explained.\n\nQuote from Alex Villanueva: \"We've been very clear that there was no sign of impairment at the scene or at the hospital, and that remains our position.\"\n\nSchack emphasized the importance of following established protocols in such investigations: \"It's crucial to follow proper procedures to ensure an accurate and thorough investigation. The absence of a DRE assessment in this case is concerning.\"\n\nForensic experts and legal professionals are urging transparency and a thorough investigation into the Tiger Woods car crash. \"The public deserves to know the truth about what happened,\" Taylor stressed.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has maintained that there was no evidence of impairment, but the absence of a DRE assessment and blood evidence has left many questions unanswered.\n\nAs Woods continues to recover from his injuries, the focus remains on the investigation and the decisions made by the Sheriff's Department during the initial response to the crash.\n\nThe case highlights the importance of following established procedures in investigations involving potential drug or alcohol impairment. \"It's essential to have a complete and accurate picture of what happened to ensure justice and accountability,\" Cherney concluded.\n\nThe Tiger Woods car crash investigation continues to unfold, with experts urging transparency and a thorough examination of all available evidence. The absence of a drug-recognition expert assessment and blood evidence has left many questions unanswered, underscoring the importance of following established protocols in such investigations."}

Paul Nakasone Announces Shift in Strategy\n\nCNN – The US military's cyberwarfare arm, US Cyber Command, has taken offensive action against ransomware attacks targeting American companies, marking one of the first clear acknowledgments of targeting criminal groups since the high-profile Colonial Pipeline attack in May.\n\nGen. Paul Nakasone, the head of Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, announced the move during a speech at the Aspen Security Forum on Saturday. \"We have taken kinetic actions against ransomware networks,\" Nakasone said, without providing specifics on the actions taken.\n\nNakasone's statement comes as US security agencies have increased efforts against ransomware groups following significant attacks on the Colonial Pipeline and a major meat processor, JBS USA. The surge against ransomware operators is aimed at cutting off their funding, according to Nakasone.\n\n\"Our objective is clear: We need to disrupt their ability to finance their operations, control their command-and-control infrastructure, and limit their ability to extort American businesses and organizations,\" Nakasone said.\n\nIn addition to military action, the US government has taken other steps to combat ransomware attacks. The Justice Department has indicted several extortionists, and the Treasury Department has sanctioned a cryptocurrency exchange for laundering money for hackers.\n\nThe White House is also pushing the Russian government to act against cybercriminals based in Russia. \"President Biden has been clear that the United States expects Russia to take action against criminal actors operating within its borders,\" a White House spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nPresident Biden is set to discuss cybersecurity in an upcoming video call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The focus on cybersecurity follows Biden's urging of Putin to tackle hacker activities during a meeting in Geneva six months ago.\n\n\"I made it clear to President Putin in Geneva that the United States expects when a ransomware operation is coming from his soil, even though it's not sponsored by the state, we expect them to act,\" Biden said during a press conference in June.\n\nThe growing threat of ransomware attacks has become a major concern for the US government and businesses. In May, the Colonial Pipeline was forced to shut down for several days after being hit by a ransomware attack, causing fuel shortages and price hikes along the East Coast.\n\nNakasone warned that ransomware attacks are a growing threat to American businesses and organizations. \"Ransomware is one of the most pressing cybersecurity challenges we face today,\" he said. \"It's a global problem that requires a global solution.\"\n\nThe US government's efforts to combat ransomware attacks are part of a broader push to improve cybersecurity and protect against foreign adversaries. In June, the Biden administration announced a series of executive orders aimed at improving the country's cybersecurity defenses.\n\n\"We need to be able to deter, detect, and respond to cyber attacks of all kinds,\" Nakasone said. \"We need to be able to defend our networks, protect our critical infrastructure, and secure our data.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the US military's Cyber Command has taken offensive action against ransomware attacks targeting American companies, marking a shift in strategy towards targeting criminal groups. The US government's counteroffensive includes military action, indictments, sanctions, and diplomatic pressure on Russia to act against cybercriminals based in the country. The focus on cybersecurity follows Biden's urging of Putin to tackle hacker activities during a meeting in Geneva six months ago. The growing threat of ransomware attacks requires a global solution, and the US government is taking steps to improve the country's cybersecurity defenses.\n\n\"We need to be able to defend our networks, protect our critical infrastructure, and secure our data,\" Gen.
